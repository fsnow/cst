# Chattha Sangayana Tipitaka (CST)

This is the get repository for CST4 (Windows) as well as development for future cross-platform clients.

The main branch has version 4.2, a work in progress to convert to the use of Lucene.NET 4.8. This is the groundwork for an upgrade to more recent cross-platform .NET releases and clients for non-Windows platforms.

The commits corresponding to the currently released versions of 4.0 and 4.1 are on separate branches and the most recent releases are also tagged.
