# AI Integration — Claude & Agent Access to the Corpus (Planned — Design of Record)

**Status:** Planned / design of record. Not started.
**Last updated:** July 2026 (reviewed + revised 2026-07-04 — see §16)
**Platform scope:** Cross-platform for the portable surfaces (HTTP + llms.txt, MCP); macOS-only for the Siri/App Intents surface.

> This is the durable design of record for the AI-integration feature area. GitHub issues track the
> work and will close; this document persists. Related issues: umbrella epic + children (see §12),
> plus #41 (App Intents / Siri = surface **A**) and #27 (vector/semantic search = surface **D**).

## 1. Motivation

CST Reader sits on a large, well-structured Pāli corpus with mature search (Lucene / IPE) and a rich
reference model. That makes it an ideal **research-assistant substrate**: a user should be able to ask an
agent a question, have it *search the corpus and the dictionaries*, and see the **results shown in context
in the reader itself** — the book open to the spot, hits highlighted — not just a snippet pasted into a chat.

Users span a **range of technical ability**, and we support both ends:
- **Coding-agent users** (Claude Code, or any agent that can run a shell / write code) → talk to a local
  HTTP API directly, oriented by an `llms.txt`.
- **BYO-MCP-chat users** (claude.ai, Claude Desktop, other MCP clients) → talk to a thin **MCP adapter**
  that proxies to the same API.

Neither user needs to know which spine they are standing on.

## 2. The surface map (A–E)

| # | Surface | What it is | Transport | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Outbound to the system assistant** | Expose CST actions/content to Siri / Apple Intelligence / Spotlight. Claude reaches CST here only indirectly (as a Siri Extension provider). | App Intents (Swift, macOS) | Documented — #41 |
| **B** | **Claude inside CST Reader** | Select a passage → explain / translate / summarize; study companion over the open text or corpus. | In-app model calls | This doc |
| **C** | **CST as a tool server** | Expose the corpus + dictionaries as tools (search, fetch-passage, resolve-reference, dictionary lookup) to external agents. | Local HTTP API (+ MCP adapter) | This doc |
| **D** | **Retrieval substrate** | Semantic search / embeddings / RAG. Not a user feature on its own — the engine B and C stand on for "answer over the corpus." | internal | Research — #27 |
| **E** | **Agent-driven "show me in context"** | Agent searches, then **drives the running reader** to present the result — open book, go to reference, highlight hits, scroll into view. | Local HTTP API (present-tool) / App Intents | This doc |

## 3. The organizing principle

> **The app is the abstraction boundary. Every AI surface is a thin adapter over an existing app service —
> so an agent gets clean semantic tools and never touches a storage format.**

An agent must never parse the **UTF-16 corpus XML**, the **Lucene segments**, or the **binary dictionary
format** — it calls *search*, *fetch-passage*, *lookup*. The service layer owns every format. Payoffs:
- **Stable contract** — when a storage format changes, or new dictionaries are added (e.g. the future
  open-source dictionaries), the tool signatures don't move; the agent is insulated.
- **One reader per format** — nobody re-implements the VRI dictionary format or the TEI XML outside the app.

## 4. Two reusable cores

Everything in §2 is an adapter over one or both of:

1. **The navigation / present-in-context command** — a single internal action:
   *"open the reader to `(book, reference/paragraph, search-terms)`, render it in context, highlight the hits."*
   Drives **E**, and backs App Intents' `OpenBook` / `GoTo` / `Search` (**A**). Front-ends (HTTP present-tool,
   App Intents, `cstreader://` URL, local IPC) are thin adapters over it.
   **It must return a structured outcome, not fire-and-forget:** what was actually resolved and opened
   (book, normalized reference, paragraph), or a precise, machine-readable failure (`unknown-book`,
   `ambiguous-reference` + candidate list, `reference-out-of-range`). The agent needs this to confirm the
   user is looking at the right passage. **Decided: ambiguity resolves agent-side** — the API returns the
   candidates and the agent asks its user; the app never pops its own pick-list for an API-initiated
   navigation, and never silently best-guess jumps. **Its highlight/anchor payload is expressed in source
   coordinates** — see the coordinate model in §6.1.
2. **The app's read services exposed as tools** — search, fetch-passage, resolve-reference, **dictionary
   lookup** — each already encapsulating its format (Lucene / TEI XML / binary dict). Backs **C** (and **B**).
   Result shapes are **token-frugal by design**: paragraph-granularity by default, explicit size limits +
   pagination on search results and passages, structured JSON with only the fields asked for.
   **Planned addition — an anchor catalog:** enumerable lookups of the *valid navigation targets*
   (`list_books()`, `list_anchors(book)` → paragraph ranges, page ranges per edition, chapter/section
   anchors), served from a **precomputed catalog** rather than parsing the TEI XML per query. This is what
   `resolve-reference` and disambiguation stand on, lets an agent know what's addressable before it asks,
   and keeps anchor queries fast.

Build the cores once; the surfaces become adapters.

## 5. Transport architecture

Do not think of HTTP *vs* MCP *vs* URL scheme — **layer them on the shared cores**:

```
        Claude Code / coding agent ──────────────┐
                                                  ▼
   BYO MCP chat ──▶ thin stdio MCP adapter ──▶  Local HTTP API (127.0.0.1/v1)  ──▶  App services + nav core
        (claude.ai, Desktop)                      ▲
   Siri / Apple Intelligence ──▶ App Intents ─────┘   (cold-start: cstreader:// URL launches, then HTTP)
        (macOS, surface A)
```

- **Local HTTP API is the spine** — the cross-platform, offline, code-mode-friendly "data + remote-control"
  surface. Serves both *data* tools and a `POST /navigate` *presentation* tool (**E**).
- **MCP is a thin, optional adapter** — a small stdio server that proxies MCP tool calls to the HTTP API,
  for chat clients that can't call HTTP themselves. **Not the foundation** (see §7).
- **URL scheme covers cold-start** — HTTP only listens while the app runs; `cstreader://…` launches it, HTTP
  takes over once up.
- **App Intents (A) is the macOS-native overlay** on the same nav core (Swift-gated; see #41).

## 6. Local HTTP API design

- **Loopback only** — bind `127.0.0.1` (and `::1`), **never** `0.0.0.0`.
- **Ephemeral port + per-session token**, both written to `…/CSTReader/local-api.json` with **owner-only
  permissions (0600)**; the MCP adapter and other clients read it to discover where to connect and how to
  authenticate. Include the app **PID** in the file so clients can detect a stale file after a crash.
- **Token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header only** — never in the URL/query string (query strings leak
  into logs and referers). This alone defeats DNS-rebinding and browser CSRF: a web page cannot attach a
  custom `Authorization` header cross-origin without a CORS preflight we will never approve.
- **No CORS at all** — never emit `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (stronger than "no wildcard"); browsers are
  not a supported client. Additionally validate `Host` is the loopback literal, and reject requests carrying
  an `Origin` header outright.
- **Honest threat model** — the token protects against *browser-origin* attacks (rebinding, CSRF). It does
  **not** protect against a malicious same-user local process — nothing at this layer can (such a process can
  read `local-api.json` exactly like our own adapter). That is the OS's trust boundary, and the corpus is not
  sensitive; the side-effectful part is UI navigation, which is visible to the user (see consent below).
- **Versioned** — `/v1/…` from day one; the moment an adapter depends on it, it's a contract.
- **Status/readiness endpoint** — `GET /v1/status`: app version, API version, index state (ready / indexing
  + progress), corpus revision. Agents (and the MCP adapter) poll this before heavy use; a `navigate` or
  `search` during startup/re-indexing degrades to a clear `not-ready` response, never a hang.
- **Single instance** — define behavior when a second app instance launches: either enforce single-instance
  (preferred; deep links and the API route to the existing instance) or per-instance files. Never let two
  instances silently clobber one `local-api.json`.
- **User consent & control** — the API is governed by Settings, mirroring the auto-update philosophy
  (#178): a master **enable/disable toggle** for the local API (off = socket never opens), and a separate
  toggle for **remote-control** (`navigate`) vs read-only data access. When an agent drives navigation, give
  a subtle visible indication in the UI so the reader is never surprised by "the app moved by itself."
  **Decided: default off** — the user opts in from Settings; nothing listens until they do. (The "Copy MCP
  configuration" affordance in §7 lives next to the toggle, so enabling and connecting are one visit.)
- **Concurrency** — handlers are another concurrent caller into `IndexingService` / `SearchService`; they must
  route through the thread-safe service layer (the reader-refcounting hardened in SRCH-6/11), never around it.
- **UI thread** — navigation/presentation must marshal to the Avalonia dispatcher.
- **Lifecycle** — starts with the app (if enabled), stops on shutdown; cold-start is the URL scheme's job (§5).
  URL-scheme registration is itself a **packaging change** (macOS: `CFBundleURLTypes` in Info.plist +
  re-sign/notarize; Windows: registry; Linux: `.desktop` file) — schedule it with phase 1 (§13).

### 6.1 Highlighting & anchors — the coordinate model

The concordance/passage **reads** (C) and the present-in-context **command** (E) share one primitive: an
ordered **highlight set with a single navigable anchor**. It has two producers — search *computes* it (a hit,
or the multi-span set of a proximity match), and the agent *supplies* it (to show the user a span it chose) —
over **one coordinate space**. Get that space right and E is nearly free; get it wrong and nothing maps.

**Three coordinate spaces; only one is contractual for highlighting.**
- **Source char offsets** — into the decoded, BOM-stripped UTF-16 corpus XML (markup and all). Script- and
  render-independent. This is already what `cursor` and search `StartOffset`/`EndOffset` are, and what the
  reader's WebView highlighter consumes. **This is the highlight coordinate space.**
- **Rendered-text offsets** — into the script-converted, markup-stripped `text` a read returns. Depends on
  `script` and `includeVariantReadings`; a Latin offset ≠ a Devanagari offset. **Display-only — never a
  highlight coordinate.** The snippet's `HitStart`/`HitLength` live here: they mark the *returned string*, nothing more.
- **WebView/DOM offsets** — internal to the reader; the app owns the source→DOM mapping.

**Invariant: every offset the agent hands to a highlight/anchor command is a *source* offset that originated
from us.** No agent-invented coordinates. This is what makes it robust: the forward render
(`Clean` strip markup → `Convert` script → `Collapse` whitespace) is non-linear and **one-way** — we discard
the mapping, so a rendered offset *cannot* be inverted back to XML. The agent therefore cannot point at the
flat prose blob; it can only reference offsets we labelled for it. (Corollary: the read surface must stop
handing out anonymous prose and start handing out *offset-anchored* data when the agent intends to act.)

**Tiered escalation — pay for precision only when acting:**
1. **Anchor + navigate — free, works today.** `cursor` (the hit's source offset) → drop an anchor, scroll
   into view. No new data; the agent already holds it.
2. **Coarse highlight — a few more fields.** "Highlight the hit word" / "highlight the whole snippet" is a
   single source *span*. Today's returns mix spaces (`cursor` = source start, but `HitLength` = *rendered*
   length), so this tier means **also surfacing the hit's source end/length and the snippet window's source
   bounds** (`winStart`/`winEnd` — the extractor already computes them).
3. **Granular highlight — opt-in token offsets.** `includeTokenOffsets: true` → `tokens: [{ text, start,
   length }]`, where `text` is in the requested `script` but `start`/`length` are **source** offsets. The
   agent composes arbitrary highlight/anchor sets word-by-word. These offsets already exist — the Lucene
   index stores per-term `StartOffset`/`EndOffset`; we are *exposing* them, not inventing a system.

**The flag: `includeTokenOffsets` (default false), on both `/v1/occurrences` and `/v1/passage`** — same
option name, same token shape. Default-off keeps the read/scan path token-frugal (§4.2); the agent flips it
only on the one call where it has decided to *display*, not merely *read*. Read cheap; highlight precise.

**Multi-word / proximity is the forcing case.** A proximity match is inherently multi-span — the blue anchor
(first unit) plus the green context units scattered across the window — so a single `HitStart`/`HitLength`
cannot represent it; the KWIC would mark only one of the co-occurring words. The snippet model therefore
carries an ordered `highlights: [{ start, length, isAnchor }]`, of which the single-term hit is the
degenerate one-range case (one implementation, not two). This also removes the dead end where a multi-word
result's `~`-joined composite `term` is round-tripped through the *single*-term occurrences lookup: instead,
occurrences accepts the multi-word/proximity query (spaces = units, quotes = phrase, `proximityDistance` =
window) and returns one occurrence per window with the full highlight set and the anchor `cursor`.

**Surface-E command** (E) then takes a highlight/anchor request in **source coordinates** —
`{ book, ranges: [{ start, length, color? }], anchor: <index into ranges> }` — fed only by offsets from
tiers 1–3. Each range may carry an optional **`color` from a small NAMED palette** (e.g. yellow / green /
blue / pink / orange), not raw hex: the app owns the actual rendering (contrast, dark mode, accessibility),
and — the point — the agent can then refer to a span **by its color** while narrating ("the compound
highlighted in green"), giving the user a shared visual vocabulary for the walkthrough. Defaults follow the
house convention (the anchor-vs-context blue/green of search highlighting); a walkthrough overrides per range.
Color is presentational only — it never touches the source-offset coordinates. (Color alone can fail
color-blind users, so the agent should still cite by paragraph/position too.)
A **content-addressed** fallback ("highlight term T in paragraph P, anchor the first") is worth keeping for
when the agent never fetched offsets: the app resolves it exactly like search, fully script-independent, no
offset math — less flexible (only findable spans) but bulletproof. This composes with §4.1's structured
outcome/error contract.

**Two verbs, not one — *set* vs. *reveal*.** *present-in-context* (above / §4.1) opens the book, sets the
highlight set, and scrolls to the anchor. A separate **reveal / go-to-anchor** verb moves the viewport to an
anchor in the **already-open** book while **preserving its current custom highlights** — no re-open, no
re-highlight. Its target is either a placed highlight (by index/id in the set the agent set) or a fresh
source-offset anchor. This is what makes a *walkthrough* cheap: the agent sets several colored highlights
once, then steps the user's attention through them ("now scroll to the yellow passage") with lightweight
reveal calls that never disturb what was placed. Keeping *reveal* distinct from *present* is the guarantee a
walkthrough can't lose the highlights it just laid down mid-tour.

## 7. Why not MCP-first

The token critique of MCP is real: a classic MCP server **front-loads every tool's schema** into context at
connect time, paid every turn. HTTP + `llms.txt` is the **progressive-disclosure / "code mode"** pattern that
avoids it — the agent reads a tiny index, fetches deeper docs only for the tools it needs, calls endpoints in
code, and takes back only the fields it asks for.

Precise conclusion — it depends on *which* Claude:
- **Code-capable agents** (shell / writes code) → **no MCP needed**; read `llms.txt`, call the API directly.
- **Non-code chat clients** (claude.ai, Desktop) → **can't** call HTTP; MCP earns its keep **there, and only there.**

So: **build HTTP + llms.txt as the foundation; keep MCP as a thin adapter** added for the chat surface. MCP
isn't obsolete — it's the interop standard and is itself moving toward progressive disclosure — but it's a
*packaging convenience, not the foundation.*

**Adapter packaging & lifecycle (decide early, it shapes UX):**
- The adapter ships **inside the app bundle** (a small executable; on macOS under `Contents/`, signed and
  notarized with everything else) so its version always matches the app's API. Users register it in their MCP
  client by absolute path; Settings should offer **"Copy MCP configuration"** producing the JSON snippet for
  Claude Desktop / claude.ai — that one affordance is most of the non-technical-user experience.
- On start, the adapter reads `local-api.json`, validates the PID, and checks `GET /v1/status`. If the app
  isn't running it returns a clear "CST Reader is not running" tool error — and may attempt cold-start via
  the URL scheme (§5) where the platform allows.
- Version skew is still possible (stale copied config, app upgraded mid-chat) — the adapter should compare
  its expected API version against `/v1/status` and say so plainly rather than half-work.

## 8. Discovery & orientation — `llms.txt`

Served over the same local port, an `llms.txt` is the agent's **front door**, with a specific advantage here:
served by the running app, it is **version-locked to the binary** — fetch it and you read the truth for *this*
build, whatever tools it exposes. It can't drift from the running surface.

- **Layered, curated (not a dump):** `GET /llms.txt` = overview + auth handshake + curated links;
  `GET /docs/{search,references,dictionary,navigation}.md` = deep detail pulled on demand; optional
  `/llms-full.txt` for one-shot ingestion. Mind the token budget — the index is read into context.
- **Index-vs-monolith — for future evaluation.** The canonical `llms.txt` form is an *annotated index of
  pointers* (token-efficient: an agent reads a lean map, then fetches only the `/docs/*` subset its task
  needs — research vs remote-control, etc.). The **current served file is effectively `llms-full` under the
  `llms.txt` name**: one self-contained doc. Keep it that way *for now* — the cold-agent tests showed the
  self-contained file is exactly why fresh agents succeeded unaided (everything in one place, no missed
  fetch), and at its current size a pointer index would add round-trips to save almost nothing. **Flip to
  index + `/docs/*` subdocs when the file gets heavy** (the highlighting/token-offset §6.1 material and the
  remote-control surface are what will tip it). Two guardrails when we do: (a) the pointer **annotations must
  be strong enough to pick the right subdoc *without* fetching it** — a weak index makes a cheap agent either
  flail or fetch everything, worse than the monolith; (b) **keep `llms-full.txt`** for agents that prefer one
  gulp. Ideally the index, the `/docs/*` subdocs, and `llms-full.txt` are all **generated from one source**
  (the single-source pipeline in §14) so they can't drift. The served `/docs/*` tree mirrors the human
  `docs/` split (spine + per-surface specs).
- **Especially necessary for CST:** the tools are unusable without domain orientation — the 14 scripts + **IPE
  encoding**, the **reference grammar** (Myanmar/PTS/VRI/Thai page + paragraph), the **book taxonomy**
  (mūla/aṭṭhakathā/ṭīkā, nikāya structure). This is its home.
- **House terminology** belongs here too, so agent-generated prose inherits the conventions (e.g. the standing
  terminology rule) instead of guessing.
- **Never serve secrets** — describe *how* to authenticate (read the token from `local-api.json`); the token
  itself is never in the docs, which are readable by anything that reaches the port.
- **Discovery is unauthenticated; everything else is not.** `GET /llms.txt` and `/docs/*.md` are served
  without the token (they contain no secrets, and it simplifies the bootstrap: read docs → learn the auth
  handshake → authenticate). All data/navigation endpoints require the bearer token.
- **Self-identifying** — `llms.txt` states the app version and API version at the top, so an agent (or a bug
  report) can always tell exactly which surface it was reading.

## 9. Dictionaries

The dictionary feature's **`DictionaryService` is a prerequisite** — it owns the binary format; the tools wrap
it. An agent never parses the dictionary files.
- Data tools: `dictionary_lookup(word, lang=en|hi)`, `dictionary_search(prefix)` → structured entries.
- Presentation tool (**E**): `show_dictionary_entry(word)` → open the dictionary panel to that entry in context.
- Format-agnostic contract survives added dictionaries (the future open-source set).

## 10. Apple security (macOS)

The app ships **hardened runtime + notarized, Developer ID, and is *not* sandboxed** (entitlements:
`cs.allow-jit`, `cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory`, `cs.disable-library-validation`, `network.client` — no
`com.apple.security.app-sandbox`). Consequences for a loopback server:
- **No new entitlement needed.** `network.client`/`network.server` are **App Sandbox** keys and are inert when
  unsandboxed; a non-sandboxed app opens listening sockets freely. Hardened runtime does not gate server sockets.
- **Notarization/Gatekeeper** never inspect bound ports.
- **Application-firewall prompt** governs real interfaces — **loopback is not firewalled**, so `127.0.0.1`-only
  avoids it.
- **macOS Local Network Privacy** (Sequoia+) covers **LAN** access — **loopback is exempt**, so it's avoided too.
- **Boundary condition:** this flips only under **App Sandbox** (e.g. Mac App Store) — then `network.server` is
  required *and* CEF-in-sandbox is a separate, larger problem. Not the current Developer-ID path.
- **Testing:** entitlement/signing/firewall behavior is invisible to `dotnet run` — the server must be validated
  on a **signed, notarized build**.

## 11. Cross-cutting constraints

- **Offline / disconnected** — the local HTTP + code-agent path is fully offline (loopback). But **B** (in-app
  Claude) and any cloud model need connectivity, cost, and a key; the offline story is on-device (Apple
  Foundation Models) or none. Every AI feature needs a graceful *not-configured / no-network* state. (Ties to the
  "mostly-disconnected users" constraint in the auto-update work.)
- **Model choice + BYO key** — see §11.1; who pays for tokens is the user, via their own key.
- **Fidelity of canonical text** — this is a sacred-text corpus; hallucinated "translations" or invented
  citations are a real hazard. Grounding (retrieve real passages, cite the reference) matters more here than in a
  typical app, and the standing terminology hard rule applies to any generated output.
- **Script of agent-facing text** — internal processing stays **IPE**; text returned *to an agent* defaults
  to **romanized (Latin-script) Pāli**, with a `script` parameter to override per request. Frontier models
  read Latin-script Pāli natively and reliably; romanized output maximizes model comprehension per token.
  A future user-facing **preferred agent script** setting may layer on top (the script-conversion infra makes
  any of the 14 scripts cheap to serve); the per-request override ships first. **Decided.**

### 11.1 Model access policy (surface B)

Decided product values for any in-app model integration:

- **Support common LLM API standards** for maximum reach and flexibility: **OpenAI-compatible Chat
  Completions** (covers most providers, aggregators, and local runners such as Ollama/LM Studio — the
  offline/private option) **plus the Anthropic Messages API** (Claude direct). **BYO key and BYO endpoint.**
- **Model quality is a fidelity feature**, not merely a preference. Curate a **recommended-for-translation
  frontier tier**; default **Claude-first**. Frontier models are genuinely strong at Pāli understanding and
  translation — do not design as if the model were the weak link; the weak link is *ungrounded use of weak
  models*.
- **Discourage free/weak models for translating canonical text** — never a default, never in the recommended
  list, and a **fidelity advisory** when one is selected for translation. Curation and advisory, not a hard
  block (flexibility is preserved; the values are stated).
- **Grounded and cited is B's design goal** — B consumes the C/D tool layer (retrieve the real passage, look
  up dictionary entries, cite the reference) rather than free-running generation. Hallucination risk is
  inverse to *model quality × grounding*; B aims at the high end of both.
- **User-editable prompt templates with presets** (translate / explain / grammar / word-by-word) — planned
  from the start.
- **Visually distinguish generated text from canonical text** wherever B renders output near the corpus
  (styling/labeling), so a reader can never mistake model output for source text.

## 12. Documentation strategy

Three markdown layers, one format, **distinct purposes** — single-source only the overlap:

| Layer | Purpose | Audience | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GitHub issues** | tracking, planning, decisions, phasing | maintainers | closed when done |
| **`docs/` design spec (this doc)** | design of record — architecture, rationale, security | developers (human + Claude Code) | planned → in-progress → implemented |
| **Served `llms.txt` + `/docs/*.md`** | runtime interaction contract (*how to call it*) | the agent, at runtime | version-locked to the binary |

- **API reference** (endpoints, params, tool signatures) → **generate** from one annotated route/tool definition
  that also drives the HTTP routes and MCP tool defs; never hand-maintain it twice.
- **Domain orientation** (scripts, IPE, references, taxonomy) → author **once** in `docs/`, embed as a build
  resource, serve verbatim as `/docs/*.md` (same markdown, dev + runtime consumers; version-locked at build).
- **Design rationale** (the A–E map, MCP-as-adapter, security) → issues + this doc **only**; the agent needs
  *how*, not *why*.

## 13. Phasing / recommendation

1. **Navigation/present-in-context core** — the single internal command (§4.1), with its structured
   outcome/error contract. Highest leverage: backs A, C, E, and reuses the deep-link routing phase-1 of #41.
   Pure-.NET, cross-platform. Includes the **URL-scheme packaging change** (§6 lifecycle note).
2. **Local HTTP API spine** (§6) — loopback + bearer token + `/v1` + `/v1/status`, Settings toggles, wired
   through the service layer; expose the read tool set (§4.2) + `POST /navigate`.
3. **Discovery & orientation** — `llms.txt` + served `/docs/*.md` (§8).
4. **Dictionary tools** (§9) — once `DictionaryService` lands.
5. **MCP adapter** (§7) — thin stdio proxy to the HTTP API, for BYO-MCP-chat users.
6. **B (in-app Claude)** and deeper **D (RAG)** — layered on the retrieval + tool substrate once it exists.

## 14. Open questions / risks

- Exact tool/endpoint set and result shapes (paragraph granularity, hit offsets). *(Script of returned text:
  **decided** — romanized default with per-request `script` override; possible future preferred-script
  setting. §11. Highlight/anchor coordinate model: **decided** — source-offset coordinate space, tiered
  cursor → source span → opt-in token offsets, `includeTokenOffsets` on occurrences + passage. §6.1.)*
- Highlight-command residuals (§6.1): token granularity (word tokens; punctuation/danda not independently
  addressable), and whether the surface-E command also accepts the content-addressed fallback from day one.
- *(Local API default: **decided — off**; user opts in from Settings. §6.)*
- *(Disambiguation: **decided — candidates back to the agent**, which asks its user; no app-side pick-list
  for API-initiated navigation. §4.1.)*
- Anchor-catalog design (§4.2): what gets precomputed and when (index time vs first request), and its shape
  (per-edition page ranges, paragraph extents, chapter anchors).
- Generation pipeline for the single-sourced API reference (annotations → routes + MCP defs + llms.txt section).
- `DictionaryService` API shape (prerequisite for §9).
- Whether **B** additionally offers an on-device model for the offline case (the BYO-endpoint support in
  §11.1 already covers local runners), or stays cloud-first + local-runner.
- Grounding/citation strategy to keep generated output faithful to the corpus (§11): how much context to
  retrieve, how citations are rendered, how translation presets constrain output.
- **Cross-model / cross-harness validation — prerequisite before freezing doc shape + scaffolding level.**
  All cold-agent validation so far is a **single cell** of the matrix: the Claude Code harness driving latest
  Opus (a strong coding agent with shell + filesystem). That is the ceiling, not the median, and it risks
  **in-family overfitting** — Claude writing docs that Claude then reads and rates well. The doc shape
  (monolith vs pointer index, §8), how prescriptive `llms.txt` must be, and past calls like Latin-over-IPE are
  really calibrated to the **weakest agent we intend to support**, so cross-model testing *sets* the spec
  rather than confirming it. Test a small matrix — `{a non-Claude frontier model, a small/cheap model} ×
  {coding agent, MCP chat client}` — watching four signals: **pointer discipline** (fetches the right
  `/docs/*` or reads inline only → monolith vs index), **invention rate** (hallucinated endpoints/params →
  how prescriptive the docs must be), **multi-step tool-loop hold** (`search → occurrences → passage`, or
  collapse to one call + a guess), and **script compliance** (honors romanized default / `outputScript`).
  Tracked in the cold-test plan (`docs/testing/LOCAL_API_COLD_TESTS.md`).

## 16. Review log

**2026-07-04 review (Fable 5)** — revisions made in place:
- §4.1: navigation command must return a **structured outcome/error** (incl. `ambiguous-reference` with
  candidates), never fire-and-forget; §4.2: token-frugal result shapes (pagination, limits).
- §6: security model tightened — bearer **header-only** token (never query), **no CORS at all** + reject
  `Origin`-bearing requests, 0600 + PID in `local-api.json`, and an **honest threat-model** statement
  (browser-origin attacks are defeated; same-user local processes are the OS's boundary, not ours).
- §6: added `GET /v1/status` (readiness/index-state; agents poll, `not-ready` instead of hangs),
  **single-instance** behavior, **Settings consent toggles** (master enable + separate remote-control
  toggle + visible indication when an agent navigates), URL-scheme registration flagged as a packaging change.
- §7: MCP **adapter packaging** — ships in the app bundle (version-matched, signed), "Copy MCP
  configuration" affordance in Settings, stale-PID/cold-start/version-skew handling.
- §8: discovery endpoints (`/llms.txt`, `/docs/*`) **unauthenticated** to simplify bootstrap; llms.txt is
  self-identifying (app + API version).
- §11: agent-facing text defaults to **romanized Pāli** (`script` override; IPE stays internal) — resolves
  a former open question. New **§11.1 model access policy** for surface B: OpenAI-compatible + Anthropic
  Messages standards, BYO key/endpoint (incl. local runners), curated frontier tier with **Claude-first**
  default, discourage free/weak models for canonical translation (advisory, not block), grounded-and-cited
  as B's design goal, prompt presets, and visual distinction of generated vs canonical text.
- §14: open questions updated (API default-on vs default-off; disambiguation UX).
- Post-review decisions (fsnow, same day): **local API defaults off** (opt-in from Settings); **romanized
  agent-facing default confirmed**, per-request `script` override first, possible preferred-script setting
  later; **disambiguation resolves agent-side** (candidates returned, agent asks its user); planned
  **anchor catalog** — precomputed lookups of valid navigation targets, faster than parsing the data files.

**2026-07-05 (fsnow + Opus 4.8)** — new **§6.1 highlight/anchor coordinate model**, worked out while
watching cold-agent iteration 7 struggle with proximity. Key realizations, now decided:
- The read surface hands the agent script-converted, markup-stripped prose plus one lonely `cursor`; the
  forward render is lossy/one-way, so a rendered offset can't be mapped back to XML. Highlighting must live
  in the **source-offset** space (what `cursor`/search offsets/the WebView highlighter already use), and
  **every offset the agent hands back must have originated from us** — no invented coordinates.
- **Tiered escalation**: `cursor` anchor+navigate (free today) → hit/snippet **source spans** (a few more
  fields; today's `HitLength` is *rendered*, not source) → **`includeTokenOffsets`** opt-in token array
  `[{ text, start, length }]` for word-level control. Flag lives on **both** occurrences and passage.
- **Proximity forced it**: a multi-span hit can't be one `HitStart/HitLength`, so the snippet model becomes
  an ordered `highlights: [{ start, length, isAnchor }]` (single-term = degenerate one-range case), and
  occurrences accepts the multi-word/proximity query directly instead of round-tripping the `~`-composite
  term through the single-term lookup. Implementation deferred pending the iteration-7 friction report.

**2026-07-06 (fsnow)** — two surface-E additions to §6.1 after reviewing the branch:
- **Per-highlight color** — each highlight range takes an optional `color` from a small NAMED palette (not
  hex), so the agent can refer to a span *by its color* while narrating ("the compound in green") and the
  app keeps control of contrast/dark-mode/accessibility. Presentational only; never affects coordinates.
- **A distinct *reveal / go-to-anchor* verb** — jump the viewport to an anchor in an *already-open,
  custom-highlighted* book **without** re-opening or clearing the highlights, so the agent can choreograph a
  walkthrough (set colored highlights once, then step attention through them) without losing what it placed.
