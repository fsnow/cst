# Avalonia Browser Embedding: A Comparison

This document outlines the primary options for embedding a Chromium-based browser in a cross-platform .NET application using the Avalonia UI framework.

## 1. The Core Problem

Modern desktop applications often need to display web content, ranging from simple HTML pages to complex, interactive web applications. For a .NET application built with Avalonia, this requires a "web view" control that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The main contenders are all based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) or platform-native equivalents.

## 2. Comparison of Alternatives

Here is a breakdown of the most viable options, their underlying technology, and their pros and cons.

---

### Option 1: CefGlue (Your Current Choice)

- **Underlying Technology**: Direct bindings to the native Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).
- **Avalonia Integration**: `CefGlue.Avalonia` NuGet package.

CefGlue is a low-level .NET wrapper around CEF. It provides direct access to the CEF API, offering maximum control and flexibility.

#### Pros:
- **True Cross-Platform**: Provides a consistent, full-featured Chromium browser on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This is its single biggest advantage for open-source projects.
- **High Control**: As a direct binding, it exposes the rich feature set of CEF, allowing for deep customization of browser behavior.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify without licensing fees.

#### Cons:
- **Complexity**: The API is low-level and can be more complex to work with compared to higher-level abstractions.
- **Manual Distribution**: You are responsible for bundling the correct CEF binaries for each target platform, which can add complexity to the build and packaging process.
- **Application Size**: Bundling the entire CEF framework significantly increases the application's distributable size (often by 100-200 MB per platform).

### Option 2: WebView2

- **Underlying Technology**: Microsoft Edge (Chromium) on Windows. It is not a standalone technology on other platforms.
- **Avalonia Integration**: `WebView2.Avalonia` NuGet package.

WebView2 is Microsoft's modern "evergreen" approach to embedding web content. The key detail for cross-platform use is that the `WebView2.Avalonia` package is a **hybrid solution**:

-   On **Windows**, it uses the official Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime.
-   On **macOS and Linux**, it falls back to using **CefGlue** as the rendering engine.

#### Pros:
- **Modern API**: Offers a cleaner, higher-level, and more modern `async`-based API than CefGlue.
- **Efficient on Windows**: On Windows, it uses the shared Edge runtime, which is highly efficient and doesn't need to be bundled with the app, resulting in a much smaller application size.
- **Single API, Multi-Platform**: Provides a consistent API for developers, abstracting away the CefGlue implementation detail on non-Windows platforms.

#### Cons:
- **Not Truly WebView2 Cross-Platform**: The name is misleading for non-Windows targets. You are still subject to the realities of CefGlue (and its larger package size) on macOS and Linux.
- **Dependency on CefGlue**: Since it relies on CefGlue for macOS/Linux, it inherits the same distribution and size challenges on those platforms.

### Option 3: Avalonia.Controls.WebView (Official & Commercial)

- **Underlying Technology**: Platform-native web rendering engines.
    - **Windows**: WebView2 (Edge)
    - **macOS/iOS**: WKWebView (Safari)
    - **Linux**: WebKitGTK
- **Avalonia Integration**: Part of the "Avalonia Accelerate" commercial offering.

This is the official, lightweight solution from the Avalonia team. It prioritizes using the OS-provided web view control.

#### Pros:
- **Extremely Lightweight**: Avoids bundling Chromium entirely, leading to a dramatically smaller application size.
- **Native Look & Feel**: Integrates perfectly with the host operating system.
- **Official Support**: Backed and maintained directly by the Avalonia development team.
- **Broadest Platform Support**: The only option that extends seamlessly to iOS and Android.

#### Cons:
- **Commercial License Required**: This is a paid product.
- **Potential for Inconsistency**: Because it uses different browser engines on each platform (Edge vs. Safari vs. WebKit), there can be subtle differences in rendering or JavaScript behavior that may require testing and workarounds.
- **Less Control than CEF**: You may not have the same deep level of control over the browser instance as you do with a full CEF-based solution like CefGlue.

### Option 4: CefSharp (Not a Viable Option)

- **Underlying Technology**: C++/CLI wrapper around CEF.
- **Avalonia Integration**: None.

CefSharp is a very popular library for WPF and WinForms, but its architecture makes it **Windows-only**. It is not, and will not be, compatible with cross-platform Avalonia development. **It should not be considered.**

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendation

Your decision to use **CefGlue** is a sound and pragmatic choice for an open-source, cross-platform Avalonia application that requires the full power and consistency of the Chromium engine on all desktop platforms.

- **Stick with CefGlue if**: You need a free, open-source solution and require the exact same Chromium rendering engine and feature set on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and you are willing to manage the larger application size.

- **Consider `WebView2.Avalonia` if**: You prefer a more modern, higher-level API and your primary target is Windows (to get the size benefits), but you still need a functional fallback for macOS and Linux.

- **Consider `Avalonia.Controls.WebView` if**: A small application size is a top priority, you are building a commercial product, and you can accommodate potential minor rendering differences between platforms.
