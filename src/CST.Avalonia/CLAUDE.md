# CST Avalonia Project Status - September 2025

## Current Status: **BETA 2 PREP - CODE SIGNING COMPLETE** üîê

**Last Updated**: September 20, 2025
**Working Directory**: `[project-root]/src/CST.Avalonia`

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinForms-based CST4, built on Avalonia UI and .NET 9. The application is a cross-platform Pali text reader featuring a modern, dock-based IDE-style interface. The active codebase is now focused solely on the current architecture, with legacy and placeholder files moved to a separate directory for clarity.

CST stands for "Cha·π≠·π≠ha Sa·πÖgƒÅyana Tipi·π≠aka". The texts we use are provided by the Vipassana Research Institute. 

Claude, do not use the word "Buddhist" in the application or any supporting documentation.

## Current Functionality

CST Reader is a modern, cross-platform Pali text reader featuring a complete implementation of the following systems:

### **Core Application Features**
1. **Dock-Based IDE Interface**: Fully functional docking system with resizable panels, tab management, and persistent layout state
2. **Complete Session Restoration**: Application saves and restores all open books, scripts, window positions, and search highlights across sessions
3. **Cross-Platform Build System**: Native macOS `.dmg` packages with proper application branding and menu integration
4. **Code Signing & Security**: Developer ID signed applications and DMG installers for macOS without "damaged" application errors on first launch
5. **Advanced Logging System**: Structured Serilog logging with configurable levels, unified across all components including CST.Lucene

### **Text Display & Script System**
6. **Multi-Script Support**:
   - **Display**: All 14 Pali scripts supported (Devanagari, Latin, Bengali, Cyrillic, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Khmer, Malayalam, Myanmar, Sinhala, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan)
   - **Input**: 9 scripts supported for search/dictionary (missing: Thai, Telugu, Tibetan, Khmer, Cyrillic)
   - **Indexing**: IPE (Internal Phonetic Encoding) with Devanagari analyzers for accurate search
7. **Per-Tab Script Selection**: Each book tab independently remembers and applies its script setting
8. **Script Synchronization**: Search results and book tree automatically update display when global script changes

### **UI Font Management System**
9. **Per-Script UI Font Configuration**: Complete font system for all 14 Pali scripts used in UI elements (search results, tree views, dropdowns) with individual font family and size settings
10. **Native Font Detection**: macOS Core Text APIs detect and filter fonts compatible with each specific script
11. **System Default Detection**: Shows actual system-chosen default fonts for each script (informational)
12. **Real-Time Font Updates**: Font changes apply immediately across all UI locations without restart
13. **DataTemplate Font Binding**: Custom FontHelper attached properties enable font settings in search results, tree views, and dropdowns
14. **Font Settings Persistence**: All UI font preferences save and restore correctly across application sessions
    - **Note**: This system covers Pali script fonts in UI elements only; book content fonts and UI localization fonts are separate systems (see Outstanding Work)

### **Search System**
15. **Full-Text Search Engine**: Complete Lucene.NET 4.8+ implementation with position-based indexing for all 217 Pali texts
16. **Advanced Search Features**:
    - Single and multi-term exact searches with accurate counting
    - Wildcard search working in all 14 scripts
    - Regular expression search support
    - Position-based highlighting with correct character offsets
17. **Smart Book Filtering**:
    - Checkbox-based filter UI for Pitaka/Commentary categories
    - "Select All/None" quick actions for filter management
    - Live book count display based on current filter selection
    - Filter summary display when collapsed
18. **Enhanced Search UI**:
    - Visual search elements (magnifying glass, clear button, progress indicator)
    - Two-column layout with terms list and book occurrences
    - Real-time search statistics and loading feedback
    - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape) and double-click navigation
19. **Search Result Integration**: Persistent highlighting saved per-tab, search terms passed to book display

### **Indexing & File Management**
20. **Incremental Indexing System**: Smart indexing that only processes changed files, not entire 217-book corpus
21. **Production-Ready Services**: Fully tested IndexingService and XmlFileDatesService with 62 comprehensive unit/integration/performance tests
22. **Empty Index Handling**: Proper startup behavior when no search index exists yet
23. **Index Integrity**: Fixed duplicate document issues, accurate search counts, proper document replacement

### **XML Update System**
24. **GitHub API Integration**: Automatic file updates using Octokit.NET with repository configuration in Settings
25. **SHA-Based Change Detection**: Only downloads files that have actually changed since local copies (avoids 1GB+ full downloads)
26. **Enhanced File Tracking**: Nullable timestamps, proper state management, separation between download and indexing states
27. **Optimized Startup Sequence**: Files updated before indexing to eliminate redundant work
28. **Reduced Logging Noise**: 95% reduction in startup logging (300KB+ ‚Üí 14KB) while preserving debug information

### **Dynamic Welcome Page System**
29. **Version-Aware Messaging**: Displays version-specific messages (beta feedback, stable notifications, outdated warnings) based on user's current version
30. **Automatic Announcements**: Shows targeted announcements and critical notices filtered by version and expiration dates
31. **GitHub Integration**: Fetches update configuration from GitHub main branch with 24-hour local caching and offline fallback
32. **Semantic Version Comparison**: Robust version parsing with support for pre-release identifiers and build metadata
33. **External Link Handling**: Welcome page links (GitHub releases, documentation) open in system browser instead of internal navigation
34. **Smart Caching**: Local cache with TTL management, graceful degradation when offline, and automatic refresh for stale data

### **User Interface Polish**
35. **Mac-Style Book Tree Icons**: Dynamic folder icons (open/closed states) with document icons for individual books
36. **Tab Overflow Fix**: Custom scrollbar styling prevents tab coverage when many books are open
37. **Clean Settings Window**: Removed all non-functional placeholder settings, only displays working functionality
38. **Application Branding**: Proper "CST Reader" branding in macOS menu bar, window titles, and bundle configuration
39. **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators, loading states, dynamic layouts, and proper iconography throughout UI
40. **Splash Screen with Progress**: Beautiful Buddha teaching image shown at startup with status updates during XML checking, downloading, and indexing operations (fully working on macOS)

### **Technical Architecture**
41. **Modern .NET 9**: Built on latest .NET with Avalonia UI 11.x for cross-platform desktop development
42. **Reactive MVVM**: ReactiveUI-based ViewModels with proper lifecycle management and event handling
43. **Dependency Injection**: Clean service architecture with Microsoft.Extensions.DI container
44. **WebView Rendering**: Uses WebViewControl-Avalonia for book content display with search highlighting

## Outstanding Work

1.  **Full UI Localization System**:
    - **Multi-Language Support**: Implement complete localization for 20+ spoken languages (matching CST4 functionality)
    - **Runtime Language Switching**: Allow users to change UI language without restart
    - **String Tables**: Port existing string tables from CST4 for all supported languages
    - **Settings Integration**: Add language selection to Settings window
    - **Resource Management**: Implement proper resource loading system for localized strings
    - **Note**: This is separate from Pali script selection but often related in user preferences
2.  **Missing Pali Script Input Parsers** (5 scripts need converters to IPE):
    - **Thai**: Thai script ‚Üí IPE converter (Thai2Ipe or Thai2Deva)
    - **Telugu**: Telugu script ‚Üí IPE converter (Telu2Ipe or Telu2Deva)
    - **Tibetan**: Tibetan script ‚Üí IPE converter (Tibt2Ipe or Tibt2Deva)
    - **Khmer**: Khmer script ‚Üí IPE converter (Khmr2Ipe or Khmr2Deva)
    - **Cyrillic**: Cyrillic script ‚Üí IPE converter (Cyrl2Ipe or Cyrl2Deva)
    - **Note**: Display works for all 14 scripts, but input (search/dictionary) only works for 9
    - **Implementation**: May use direct Script‚ÜíIPE or indirect Script‚ÜíDeva‚ÜíIPE path
3.  **UI Language Font System**:
    - **Localization Font Settings**: Separate font controls for ~20 UI languages (distinct from Pali script fonts)
    - **Font Discovery**: Detect available fonts suitable for each UI language script
    - **Note**: This is separate from Pali script fonts - refers to UI language localization fonts
4.  **Book Content Font Management System**:
    - **Current Limitation**: Book fonts are hardcoded in XSL stylesheets (e.g., `.book { font-size: 21pt; }`), requiring manual XSL editing for customization (as in CST4)
    - **Per-Script Book Fonts**: Implement user-configurable font families for book content display, separate from UI fonts
    - **Book Font Sizing**: Add font size controls for different book content elements (titles, paragraphs, footnotes, etc.)
    - **XSL Integration**: Dynamic XSL generation or CSS injection to apply user font preferences to WebView book content
    - **Style Customization**: Support for different paragraph styles tagged in TEI XML (matching CST4's XSL customization capabilities)
    - **Preview System**: Live preview of font changes in book display
    - **Import/Export**: Allow users to share book font configurations
    - **Note**: This is the third distinct font system - separate from both UI Pali script fonts (#9-14) and UI localization fonts (#3)
5.  **Advanced Search Features**:
    - **Phrase Search**: Implement position-based phrase searching with exact word order matching
    - **Proximity Search**: Add proximity operators for terms within specified distances
6.  **Search Filtering & Collections**:
    - **Custom Book Collections**: Implement user-defined book collection feature
7.  **UI Feedback During Operations**:
    - **Indexing Progress**: Show progress bar/spinner during index building
    - **Search State**: Indicate when index is incomplete or being rebuilt
    - **Operation Notifications**: Alert user when long operations complete
    - **XML Download Progress**: Show progress bar/notifications during file downloads
    - **Update History**: Track and display XML update history for transparency
8.  **Book Display Features**:
    - **Show/Hide Footnotes Toggle**: Add footnote visibility control (check CST4 UI for exact naming)
    - **Show/Hide Search Hits Toggle**: Add search hit highlighting visibility control (check CST4 UI for exact naming)
    - **Search Hit Restoration**: Fix bug where highlighted search hits are not restored when reopening books at startup
9.  **Search Navigation Enhancement**:
    - Add keyboard shortcuts for search hit navigation (First/Previous/Next/Last)
10.  **Recent Books Feature**:
    - **File Menu Integration**: Add "Recent Books" submenu to File menu or main UI
    - **MRU List Display**: Show recently opened books with titles and last-opened dates
    - **Smart Tracking**: Automatically add books to recent list when opened
    - **Settings Integration**: Re-implement MaxRecentBooks setting to control list size
    - **Persistence**: Leverage existing ApplicationState.RecentBooks infrastructure
    - **User Experience**: Quick access to frequently used texts
    - **Note**: Partial backend exists - ApplicationState.Preferences.RecentBooks list, RecentBookItem model, AddRecentBook() method, but no UI integration and book tracking not implemented

## Outstanding Work for Beta 2 Release
