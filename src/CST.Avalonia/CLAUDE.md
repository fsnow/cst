# CST Avalonia Project Status - August 2025

## Current Status: **SEARCH SYSTEM OPERATIONAL - BUG FIXES COMPLETE** âœ…

**Last Updated**: August 15, 2025
**Working Directory**: `/Users/fsnow/github/fsnow/cst/src/CST.Avalonia`

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinForms-based CST4, built on Avalonia UI and .NET 9. The application is a cross-platform Buddhist text reader featuring a modern, dock-based IDE-style interface. The active codebase is now focused solely on the current architecture, with legacy and placeholder files moved to a separate directory for clarity.

## Latest Session Update (2025-08-15)

### âœ… **Major Bug Fixes: Search & Script Conversion Issues Resolved**

#### **Fixed: Incremental Indexing Creating Duplicates**
- **Problem**: Search showing inflated counts (55 instead of 11) due to duplicate documents in index
- **Root Cause**: `BookIndexer.IndexBook` failed to delete old documents - "file" field was StoredField (not searchable)
- **Solution**: Changed "file" from StoredField to StringField in BookIndexer.cs
- **Result**: Search counts now accurate (11 for 'bhikkhusaá¹…ghaÃ±ca', 20 for 'bhikkhusaá¹…ghena')

#### **Fixed: Devanagari Wildcard Search Failure**
- **Problem**: Wildcard searches like "a*" failed with KeyNotFoundException when script set to Devanagari
- **Root Cause**: Malformed dictionary entry in `Latn2Deva.cs` - had `"\u1E6D', 'h"` instead of `"\u1E6Dh"` for "á¹­h"
- **Solution**: Fixed the dictionary entry syntax in CST.Core/Conversion/Latn2Deva.cs
- **Result**: All script conversions work correctly, wildcard searches function in all 14 scripts
- **Test Suite**: Created comprehensive ScriptConverterTests.cs validating round-trip conversions

#### **Search System Status**
- **âœ… Basic Search**: Single and multi-term exact searches with accurate counting
- **âœ… Wildcard Search**: Now works in all scripts including Devanagari
- **âœ… Position-Based Highlighting**: Multi-term highlighting with correct offsets
- **âœ… Script Conversion**: All 14 Pali scripts convert correctly
- **âœ… Index Integrity**: Incremental indexing properly replaces documents

## Previous Session Updates (2025-08-09)

### âœ… **MAJOR MILESTONE: Incremental Indexing Bug Fixes Complete**
- **Bug Fix #1 - Incremental Detection**: Fixed issue where file changes weren't being detected for indexing by removing conditional check in `App.axaml.cs:line 86`
- **Bug Fix #2 - Settings Enhancement**: Added logic to save default index directory to settings when created for first time in `IndexingService.cs:lines 46-49`
- **Bug Fix #3 - Critical Performance Fix**: Fixed major bug where incremental indexing processed all 217 books instead of only changed files
  - **Root Cause**: `BookIndexer.cs:lines 79-88` was indexing all books with `DocId < 0`, not just the changed ones
  - **Solution**: Modified `IndexAll` method to only process books in the `changedFiles` list during incremental updates
  - **Impact**: Incremental indexing now properly handles single file changes without reprocessing entire corpus
  - **Test Validation**: Created `IncrementalIndexingOnlyChangedBooksTest` confirming fix works correctly

### âœ… **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Complete Indexing System Implementation**
- **Full Index Implementation**: Successfully implemented all phases 1-3 of the indexing plan, with all 217 books indexed.
- **CST.Lucene Integration**: Modern Lucene.NET 4.8+ implementation with async support, progress reporting, and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Production Services**: `IndexingService` and `XmlFileDatesService` fully implemented with dependency injection integration.
- **Index Created**: Successfully created search index for all 217 Buddhist texts with position-based search support.

### âœ… **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Comprehensive Testing & Optimization (Phase 4)**
- **62 Tests Implemented**: Complete test coverage with 100% pass rate including unit, integration, and performance tests.
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Unit Tests**: XmlFileDatesService, IndexingService, corruption recovery, multi-script support
  - **Integration Tests**: Full service integration, cross-service communication, lifecycle management
  - **Performance Tests**: Speed benchmarking, memory optimization, consistency validation
  - **Structure Tests**: Position-based search verification, index integrity, multi-document handling
- **Performance Validated**: All services meet performance targets (< 1s initialization, < 100ms validation, < 10MB memory)

### âœ… **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Project Cleanup & Refactoring**
- **Dead Code Identified**: Analyzed the `.csproj` file to identify numerous files from a previous architectural approach that were excluded from the build.
- **Inactive Code Archived**: Created a new `CST.Avalonia_inactive` directory to house all legacy and placeholder files, clarifying the current state of the active project.
  - **Moved Files**: `BookService.cs`, `SearchService.cs`, the legacy `MainWindow.axaml` and its code-behind, and other unused View and ViewModel files were relocated.
- **Project File Cleanup**: Removed all obsolete `<Compile Remove>` and `<AvaloniaResource Remove>` tags from `CST.Avalonia.csproj`, making the project file clean and consistent with the active source tree.

### **Previously Completed Milestones**
- **Docking UI**: Migrated to `Dock.Avalonia` for a flexible, multi-pane IDE-style layout.
- **Full State Restoration**: The application saves and restores its complete state (open books, scripts, window size, etc.).
- **Settings Window**: A complete settings dialog is implemented and functional.
- **WebView Confirmed**: The project uses `WebViewControl-Avalonia` for rendering.

### **Key Code Analysis Findings:**

#### 1. **Architecture & Dependencies**
- **`CST.Avalonia.csproj` Analysis**:
  - The project file is now clean and only references active source code.
  - Placeholder and legacy files for features like the `SearchService` are no longer referenced and have been physically moved.
- **Service Configuration (`App.axaml.cs`)**:
  - **Active Services**: `IApplicationStateService`, `ISettingsService`, `IScriptService`, `ILocalizationService`, `IIndexingService`, `IXmlFileDatesService`, `ISearchService`.
  - **Search Integration**: SearchService fully integrated with DI and connected to the Lucene index.

## Current Functionality

### **Working Features**
1.  **Dock-Based UI**: Fully functional IDE-style interface.
2.  **Session Restore**: Application correctly reopens all previously opened books.
3.  **Per-Tab Script Selection**: Each book tab remembers its script setting.
4.  **Persistent Highlighting**: Search terms are saved per-tab and reapplied on restore.
5.  **Settings Dialog**: Functional settings window.
6.  **Advanced Logging**: Configurable Serilog implementation.
7.  **Cross-Platform Build**: `.dmg` packages are being built for macOS.
8.  **Full Indexing System**: Complete Lucene.NET search index for all 217 books with incremental updates.
9.  **Multi-Script Support**: 
    - **Display**: All 14 Pali scripts supported (Devanagari, Latin, Bengali, Cyrillic, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Khmer, Malayalam, Myanmar, Sinhala, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan)
    - **Input**: 9 scripts supported for search/dictionary (missing: Thai, Telugu, Tibetan, Khmer, Cyrillic)
    - **Indexing**: IPE (Internal Phonetic Encoding) with Devanagari analyzers
10. **Production-Ready Services**: Fully tested IndexingService and XmlFileDatesService with 62 comprehensive tests.
11. **ðŸ†• Live Search UI**: Functional search panel with real-time results and book filtering.
12. **ðŸ†• Search Result Highlighting**: Position-based highlighting with navigation support (single-term tested).

## Outstanding Work (High Priority)

1.  **Missing Pali Script Input Parsers** (5 scripts need converters to IPE):
    - **Thai**: Thai script â†’ IPE converter (Thai2Ipe or Thai2Deva)
    - **Telugu**: Telugu script â†’ IPE converter (Telu2Ipe or Telu2Deva)
    - **Tibetan**: Tibetan script â†’ IPE converter (Tibt2Ipe or Tibt2Deva)
    - **Khmer**: Khmer script â†’ IPE converter (Khmr2Ipe or Khmr2Deva)
    - **Cyrillic**: Cyrillic script â†’ IPE converter (Cyrl2Ipe or Cyrl2Deva)
    - **Note**: Display works for all 14 scripts, but input (search/dictionary) only works for 9
    - **Implementation**: May use direct Scriptâ†’IPE or indirect Scriptâ†’Devaâ†’IPE path
2.  **Font Management System**:
    - **Pali Font Settings**: Per-script font family and size controls for 14 Pali scripts
    - **Localization Font Settings**: Separate font controls for ~20 UI languages
    - **Font Discovery**: Detect available fonts suitable for each script
    - **Dynamic Application**: Apply font changes throughout UI without restart
3.  **Advanced Search Features**:
    - **Phrase Search**: Implement position-based phrase searching with exact word order matching
    - **Proximity Search**: Add proximity operators for terms within specified distances
4.  **Search Filtering & Collections**:
    - **Book Collection Filters**: Fix non-functional checkboxes for Pitaka/Commentary filtering
    - **Custom Book Collections**: Implement user-defined book collection feature
5.  **UI Feedback During Operations**:
    - **Indexing Progress**: Show progress bar/spinner during index building
    - **Search State**: Indicate when index is incomplete or being rebuilt
    - **Operation Notifications**: Alert user when long operations complete
6.  **Search Navigation Enhancement**:
    - Add keyboard shortcuts for search hit navigation (First/Previous/Next/Last)
    - Implement scroll-to-hit functionality
    - Add hit counter display (e.g., "Hit 3 of 15")
