# CST Avalonia Project Status - October 2025

## Current Status: **BETA 2 RELEASE READY** üöÄ

**Last Updated**: October 4, 2025
**Working Directory**: `[project-root]/src/CST.Avalonia`

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinForms-based CST4, built on Avalonia UI and .NET 9. The application is a cross-platform Pali text reader featuring a modern, dock-based IDE-style interface. The active codebase is now focused solely on the current architecture, with legacy and placeholder files moved to a separate directory for clarity.

CST stands for "Cha·π≠·π≠ha Sa·πÖgƒÅyana Tipi·π≠aka". The texts we use are provided by the Vipassana Research Institute. 

Claude, do not use the word "Buddhist" in the application or any supporting documentation.

## Current Functionality

CST Reader is a modern, cross-platform Pali text reader featuring a complete implementation of the following systems:

### **Core Application Features**
1. **Dock-Based IDE Interface**: Fully functional docking system with resizable panels, tab management, and persistent layout state
2. **Complete Session Restoration**: Application saves and restores all open books, scripts, window positions, and search highlights across sessions
3. **Cross-Platform Build System**: Native macOS `.dmg` packages with proper application branding and menu integration
4. **Code Signing & Security**: Developer ID signed applications and DMG installers for macOS without "damaged" application errors on first launch
5. **Advanced Logging System**: Structured Serilog logging with configurable levels, unified across all components including CST.Lucene

### **Text Display & Script System**
6. **Multi-Script Support**:
   - **Display**: All 14 Pali scripts supported (Devanagari, Latin, Bengali, Cyrillic, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Khmer, Malayalam, Myanmar, Sinhala, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan)
   - **Input**: 9 scripts supported for search/dictionary (missing: Thai, Telugu, Tibetan, Khmer, Cyrillic)
   - **Indexing**: IPE (Internal Phonetic Encoding) with Devanagari analyzers for accurate search
7. **Per-Tab Script Selection**: Each book tab independently remembers and applies its script setting
8. **Script Synchronization**: Search results and book tree automatically update display when global script changes

### **UI Font Management System**
9. **Per-Script UI Font Configuration**: Complete font system for all 14 Pali scripts used in UI elements (search results, tree views, dropdowns) with individual font family and size settings
10. **Native Font Detection**: macOS Core Text APIs detect and filter fonts compatible with each specific script
11. **System Default Detection**: Shows actual system-chosen default fonts for each script (informational)
12. **Real-Time Font Updates**: Font changes apply immediately across all UI locations without restart
13. **DataTemplate Font Binding**: Custom FontHelper attached properties enable font settings in search results, tree views, and dropdowns
14. **Font Settings Persistence**: All UI font preferences save and restore correctly across application sessions
    - **Note**: This system covers Pali script fonts in UI elements only; book content fonts and UI localization fonts are separate systems (see Outstanding Work)

### **Search System**
15. **Full-Text Search Engine**: Complete Lucene.NET 4.8+ implementation with position-based indexing for all 217 Pali texts
16. **Advanced Search Features**:
    - Single and multi-term exact searches with accurate counting
    - Wildcard search working in all 14 scripts
    - Regular expression search support
    - Position-based highlighting with correct character offsets
17. **Smart Book Filtering**:
    - Checkbox-based filter UI for Pitaka/Commentary categories
    - "Select All/None" quick actions for filter management
    - Live book count display based on current filter selection
    - Filter summary display when collapsed
18. **Enhanced Search UI**:
    - Visual search elements (magnifying glass, clear button, progress indicator)
    - Two-column layout with terms list and book occurrences
    - Real-time search statistics and loading feedback
    - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape) and double-click navigation
19. **Search Result Integration**: Persistent highlighting saved per-tab, search terms passed to book display

### **Indexing & File Management**
20. **Incremental Indexing System**: Smart indexing that only processes changed files, not entire 217-book corpus
21. **Production-Ready Services**: Fully tested IndexingService and XmlFileDatesService with 62 comprehensive unit/integration/performance tests
22. **Empty Index Handling**: Proper startup behavior when no search index exists yet
23. **Index Integrity**: Fixed duplicate document issues, accurate search counts, proper document replacement

### **XML Update System**
24. **GitHub API Integration**: Automatic file updates using Octokit.NET with repository configuration in Settings
25. **SHA-Based Change Detection**: Only downloads files that have actually changed since local copies (avoids 1GB+ full downloads)
26. **Enhanced File Tracking**: Nullable timestamps, proper state management, separation between download and indexing states
27. **Optimized Startup Sequence**: Files updated before indexing to eliminate redundant work
28. **Reduced Logging Noise**: 95% reduction in startup logging (300KB+ ‚Üí 14KB) while preserving debug information

### **Dynamic Welcome Page System**
29. **Version-Aware Messaging**: Displays version-specific messages (beta feedback, stable notifications, outdated warnings) based on user's current version
30. **Automatic Announcements**: Shows targeted announcements and critical notices filtered by version and expiration dates
31. **GitHub Integration**: Fetches update configuration from GitHub main branch with 24-hour local caching and offline fallback
32. **Semantic Version Comparison**: Robust version parsing with support for pre-release identifiers and build metadata
33. **External Link Handling**: Welcome page links (GitHub releases, documentation) open in system browser instead of internal navigation
34. **Smart Caching**: Local cache with TTL management, graceful degradation when offline, and automatic refresh for stale data

### **User Interface Polish**
35. **Mac-Style Book Tree Icons**: Dynamic folder icons (open/closed states) with document icons for individual books
36. **Tab Overflow Fix**: Custom scrollbar styling prevents tab coverage when many books are open
37. **Clean Settings Window**: Removed all non-functional placeholder settings, only displays working functionality
38. **Application Branding**: Proper "CST Reader" branding in macOS menu bar, window titles, and bundle configuration
39. **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators, loading states, dynamic layouts, and proper iconography throughout UI
40. **Splash Screen with Progress**: Beautiful Buddha teaching image shown at startup with status updates during XML checking, downloading, and indexing operations (fully working on macOS)

### **Technical Architecture**
41. **Modern .NET 9**: Built on latest .NET with Avalonia UI 11.x for cross-platform desktop development
42. **Reactive MVVM**: ReactiveUI-based ViewModels with proper lifecycle management and event handling
43. **Dependency Injection**: Clean service architecture with Microsoft.Extensions.DI container
44. **WebView Rendering**: Uses WebViewControl-Avalonia for book content display with search highlighting
45. **Comprehensive Testing**: 65+ tests covering unit, integration, and performance scenarios with 100% pass rate

## Beta 2 Development (October 2025)

**Status**: Complete and released

### **Critical Issues Resolved**

#### **1. CEF WebView Packaging (Completed)**
- **Problem**: Packaged app crashed on startup with "Unable to find SubProcess" error
- **Root Cause**: CEF requires 4 helper app bundles in `Contents/Frameworks/` on macOS, but we had the subprocess in `Contents/MacOS/CefGlueBrowserProcess/`
- **Solution**:
  - Created 4 CEF Helper bundles (Main, GPU, Plugin, Renderer) with proper Info.plist files
  - Each helper contains a shell script launcher that calls the actual .NET subprocess
  - Shell scripts change to `CefGlueBrowserProcess/` directory before executing to ensure runtime dependencies are found
- **Documentation**: See `markdown/notes/CEF_HELPER_PACKAGING.md`

#### **2. Code Signing & Notarization (Completed)**
- **Developer ID Signing**: All components signed with Apple Developer ID Application certificate
- **Hardened Runtime**: Applied to all executables and dylibs, including `CefGlueBrowserProcess/Xilium.CefGlue.BrowserProcess`
- **Entitlements**: JIT and unsigned memory entitlements for .NET runtime
- **DMG Signing**: Distribution packages fully signed and notarized
- **Automated Build**: Enhanced `package-macos.sh` script with integrated signing workflow
- **Result**: Apps launch without quarantine warnings or "damaged" errors

### **Beta 2 Release Goals**
- Eliminate "damaged" application errors on first launch
- Provide professional, signed DMG installers for seamless user experience
- Maintain all existing functionality from Beta 1
- Enable distribution through standard channels without security workarounds

### **Version Update Locations for Beta 2**
When preparing for Beta 2 release, the version number "5.0.0-beta.1" must be updated to "5.0.0-beta.2" in the following locations:

**Critical Files** (Must Update):
1. **`src/CST.Avalonia/CST.Avalonia.csproj`** - 4 occurrences:
   - Line 13: `<CFBundleVersion>`
   - Line 14: `<CFBundleShortVersionString>`
   - Line 18: `<Version>`
   - Line 21: `<InformationalVersion>`

2. **`src/CST.Avalonia/Info.plist`** - 2 occurrences:
   - Line 12: `<string>` under `CFBundleShortVersionString`
   - Line 14: `<string>` under `CFBundleVersion`

3. **`welcome-updates.json`** (root directory) - Update for Beta 2 announcements:
   - Line 6: Update `"beta":` to point to "5.0.0-beta.2"
   - Add new message block for "5.0.0-beta.2"
   - Update existing "5.0.0-beta.1" message if needed

4. **`src/CST.Avalonia/Services/WelcomeUpdateService.cs`**:
   - Line 33: Default version fallback (currently hardcoded to "5.0.0-beta.1")

**Documentation Files** (Should Update):
5. **`src/CST.Avalonia/CLAUDE.md`**:
   - Line 101: Beta 1 release version reference
   - Line 110: GitHub release URL
   - Add new Beta 2 release section

6. **`src/CST.Avalonia/Resources/welcome-content.html`** (Static fallback):
   - Line 184: Version display
   - Line 307: Footer version

**Note**: The version in compiled output files (`bin/Release/`) will be updated automatically when the project is rebuilt. Test files and markdown documentation references can remain as historical examples.

## Known Limitations

### **macOS CPU Usage**

CST Reader exhibits elevated CPU usage on macOS compared to typical desktop applications:

- **~30% CPU** with only the welcome page open (single WebView)
- **~60% CPU** with 3 books open (3 WebView instances)
- Main process typically uses **27-30%** when idle

**Root Cause**: This is a known limitation of Avalonia's macOS native backend (`libAvaloniaNative.dylib`). The framework's `Signaler` class creates a CFRunLoop observer that fires on every run loop iteration, causing continuous background processing. CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) amplifies this effect by performing process monitoring and rendering checks on each callback.

**Comparison with Other Platforms**:
- macOS (M1): 6-10% idle (Avalonia baseline) vs Windows: 0.48% idle
- CST Reader's usage is proportional to the number of open WebView instances

**User Mitigation**:
- Close book tabs when not in use (each tab adds ~10% CPU)
- Keep welcome page open when idle (lowest CPU state)

**Technical Details**: See `markdown/notes/AVALONIA_HIGH_CPU.md` for complete analysis including CPU profiling data, stack traces, and references to Avalonia GitHub issues (#11070, #15894).

**Note**: This is an Avalonia framework limitation, not a CST Reader bug. Future improvements depend on Avalonia framework optimizations or alternative rendering approaches.

## Outstanding Work

1.  **Full UI Localization System**:
    - **Multi-Language Support**: Implement complete localization for 20+ spoken languages (matching CST4 functionality)
    - **Runtime Language Switching**: Allow users to change UI language without restart
    - **String Tables**: Port existing string tables from CST4 for all supported languages
    - **Settings Integration**: Add language selection to Settings window
    - **Resource Management**: Implement proper resource loading system for localized strings
    - **Note**: This is separate from Pali script selection but often related in user preferences
2.  **Missing Pali Script Input Parsers** (5 scripts need converters to IPE):
    - **Thai**: Thai script ‚Üí IPE converter (Thai2Ipe or Thai2Deva)
    - **Telugu**: Telugu script ‚Üí IPE converter (Telu2Ipe or Telu2Deva)
    - **Tibetan**: Tibetan script ‚Üí IPE converter (Tibt2Ipe or Tibt2Deva)
    - **Khmer**: Khmer script ‚Üí IPE converter (Khmr2Ipe or Khmr2Deva)
    - **Cyrillic**: Cyrillic script ‚Üí IPE converter (Cyrl2Ipe or Cyrl2Deva)
    - **Note**: Display works for all 14 scripts, but input (search/dictionary) only works for 9
    - **Implementation**: May use direct Script‚ÜíIPE or indirect Script‚ÜíDeva‚ÜíIPE path
3.  **UI Language Font System**:
    - **Localization Font Settings**: Separate font controls for ~20 UI languages (distinct from Pali script fonts)
    - **Font Discovery**: Detect available fonts suitable for each UI language script
    - **Note**: This is separate from Pali script fonts - refers to UI language localization fonts
4.  **Book Content Font Management System**:
    - **Current Limitation**: Book fonts are hardcoded in XSL stylesheets (e.g., `.book { font-size: 21pt; }`), requiring manual XSL editing for customization (as in CST4)
    - **Per-Script Book Fonts**: Implement user-configurable font families for book content display, separate from UI fonts
    - **Book Font Sizing**: Add font size controls for different book content elements (titles, paragraphs, footnotes, etc.)
    - **XSL Integration**: Dynamic XSL generation or CSS injection to apply user font preferences to WebView book content
    - **Style Customization**: Support for different paragraph styles tagged in TEI XML (matching CST4's XSL customization capabilities)
    - **Preview System**: Live preview of font changes in book display
    - **Import/Export**: Allow users to share book font configurations
    - **Note**: This is the third distinct font system - separate from both UI Pali script fonts (#9-14) and UI localization fonts (#3)
5.  **Advanced Search Features**:
    - **Phrase Search**: Implement position-based phrase searching with exact word order matching
    - **Proximity Search**: Add proximity operators for terms within specified distances
6.  **Search Filtering & Collections**:
    - **Custom Book Collections**: Implement user-defined book collection feature
7.  **UI Feedback During Operations**:
    - **Indexing Progress**: Show progress bar/spinner during index building
    - **Search State**: Indicate when index is incomplete or being rebuilt
    - **Operation Notifications**: Alert user when long operations complete
    - **XML Download Progress**: Show progress bar/notifications during file downloads
    - **Update History**: Track and display XML update history for transparency
8.  **Book Display Features**:
    - **Show/Hide Footnotes Toggle**: Add footnote visibility control (check CST4 UI for exact naming)
    - **Show/Hide Search Hits Toggle**: Add search hit highlighting visibility control (check CST4 UI for exact naming)
    - **Search Hit Restoration** ‚≠ê **BETA 3 PRIORITY**: Fix bug where highlighted search hits are not restored when reopening books at startup
    - **Splash Screen Issues**: Deferred post-Beta 2 - status text updates and automatic closing don't work in packaged apps (works fine in development)
9.  **Search Navigation Enhancement**:
    - Add keyboard shortcuts for search hit navigation (First/Previous/Next/Last)
10.  **Recent Books Feature**:
    - **File Menu Integration**: Add "Recent Books" submenu to File menu or main UI
    - **MRU List Display**: Show recently opened books with titles and last-opened dates
    - **Smart Tracking**: Automatically add books to recent list when opened
    - **Settings Integration**: Re-implement MaxRecentBooks setting to control list size
    - **Persistence**: Leverage existing ApplicationState.RecentBooks infrastructure
    - **User Experience**: Quick access to frequently used texts
    - **Note**: Partial backend exists - ApplicationState.Preferences.RecentBooks list, RecentBookItem model, AddRecentBook() method, but no UI integration and book tracking not implemented

## Development Guidelines for Claude

### TodoWrite Usage - IMPORTANT

**ALWAYS use TodoWrite when:**
- Diagnosing issues with **multiple potential causes** (e.g., "this could be A, B, or C")
- Implementing features requiring **3+ distinct steps**
- Working through **any systematic checklist** (testing, deployment, debugging)
- The user provides **a list of tasks** to complete
- Starting work on **non-trivial, multi-step tasks**

**How to use TodoWrite effectively:**
1. **Create the list IMMEDIATELY** when you identify multiple steps/causes
2. **Work through ALL items systematically** - don't stop after the first fix
3. **Mark tasks complete as you finish them** - keep the user informed of progress
4. **Verify assumptions** - check for existing solutions before adding new ones

**Example - Multi-Cause Debugging:**
```
When I identify: "This hang is likely due to: 1) Network entitlements 2) Infinite timeout 3) DNS issues"
I should IMMEDIATELY create:
- [ ] Check if network entitlements exist
- [ ] Add network entitlements if missing
- [ ] Add timeouts to prevent infinite hangs
- [ ] Verify DNS resolution in packaged app

Then work through ALL items, not just the first one that seems to help.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents incomplete fixes that leave users stuck
- Ensures systematic coverage of all potential issues
- Keeps both Claude and user aligned on progress
- Critical for release-blocking bugs where partial fixes waste time

### macOS Code Signing & Entitlements

**Required Entitlements** (in `package-macos.sh`):

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required for .NET JIT compilation -->

<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required for .NET runtime -->

<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required to load .NET assemblies -->

<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required for outgoing network connections (GitHub API, downloads) -->
```

**When Adding New Features:**
1. **Check if new entitlements are needed** - consult [Apple's Entitlement Key Reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements)
2. **Common additional entitlements you might need:**
   - `com.apple.security.network.server` - Incoming network connections
   - `com.apple.security.device.camera` - Camera access
   - `com.apple.security.device.microphone` - Microphone access
   - `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write` - Downloads folder access
   - `com.apple.security.print` - Printing capabilities
   - `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` - Enable App Sandbox (currently disabled)

3. **Test entitlements after packaging:**
   ```bash
   # Verify entitlements are embedded
   codesign -d --entitlements - "/Applications/CST Reader.app"
   ```

**Critical:** Notarized apps **WILL FAIL SILENTLY** without proper entitlements. Network calls will hang indefinitely (causing high CPU from retry loops) rather than showing clear errors.

## Next Steps

With font system, script synchronization, and basic search functionality complete, the immediate priorities are:

1. **Missing Script Input Support**: Implement converters for Thai, Telugu, Tibetan, Khmer, and Cyrillic scripts to enable search input in all 14 Pali scripts
2. **Phrase & Proximity Search**: Implement position-based phrase and proximity searching using the existing term vector infrastructure  
3. **Search Filtering**: Fix book collection checkboxes and implement custom collection support for targeted searches
4. **Advanced Search Features**: Complete multi-term highlighting testing and add search navigation enhancements

The core infrastructure is robust with font management, script conversion, accurate search counting, and real-time UI updates all working correctly. Focus now shifts to completing script input support and advanced search features.
