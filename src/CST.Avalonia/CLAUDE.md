# CST Avalonia Project Status - August 2025

## Current Status: **INDEXING & TESTING COMPLETE** âœ…

**Last Updated**: August 9, 2025
**Working Directory**: `/Users/fsnow/github/fsnow/cst/src/CST.Avalonia`

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinForms-based CST4, built on Avalonia UI and .NET 9. The application is a cross-platform Buddhist text reader featuring a modern, dock-based IDE-style interface. The active codebase is now focused solely on the current architecture, with legacy and placeholder files moved to a separate directory for clarity.

## Previous Session Updates (2025-08-09)

### âœ… **MAJOR MILESTONE: Incremental Indexing Bug Fixes Complete**
- **Bug Fix #1 - Incremental Detection**: Fixed issue where file changes weren't being detected for indexing by removing conditional check in `App.axaml.cs:line 86`
- **Bug Fix #2 - Settings Enhancement**: Added logic to save default index directory to settings when created for first time in `IndexingService.cs:lines 46-49`
- **Bug Fix #3 - Critical Performance Fix**: Fixed major bug where incremental indexing processed all 217 books instead of only changed files
  - **Root Cause**: `BookIndexer.cs:lines 79-88` was indexing all books with `DocId < 0`, not just the changed ones
  - **Solution**: Modified `IndexAll` method to only process books in the `changedFiles` list during incremental updates
  - **Impact**: Incremental indexing now properly handles single file changes without reprocessing entire corpus
  - **Test Validation**: Created `IncrementalIndexingOnlyChangedBooksTest` confirming fix works correctly

### âœ… **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Complete Indexing System Implementation**
- **Full Index Implementation**: Successfully implemented all phases 1-3 of the indexing plan, with all 217 books indexed.
- **CST.Lucene Integration**: Modern Lucene.NET 4.8+ implementation with async support, progress reporting, and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Production Services**: `IndexingService` and `XmlFileDatesService` fully implemented with dependency injection integration.
- **Index Created**: Successfully created search index for all 217 Buddhist texts with position-based search support.

### âœ… **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Comprehensive Testing & Optimization (Phase 4)**
- **62 Tests Implemented**: Complete test coverage with 100% pass rate including unit, integration, and performance tests.
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Unit Tests**: XmlFileDatesService, IndexingService, corruption recovery, multi-script support
  - **Integration Tests**: Full service integration, cross-service communication, lifecycle management
  - **Performance Tests**: Speed benchmarking, memory optimization, consistency validation
  - **Structure Tests**: Position-based search verification, index integrity, multi-document handling
- **Performance Validated**: All services meet performance targets (< 1s initialization, < 100ms validation, < 10MB memory)

### âœ… **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Project Cleanup & Refactoring**
- **Dead Code Identified**: Analyzed the `.csproj` file to identify numerous files from a previous architectural approach that were excluded from the build.
- **Inactive Code Archived**: Created a new `CST.Avalonia_inactive` directory to house all legacy and placeholder files, clarifying the current state of the active project.
  - **Moved Files**: `BookService.cs`, `SearchService.cs`, the legacy `MainWindow.axaml` and its code-behind, and other unused View and ViewModel files were relocated.
- **Project File Cleanup**: Removed all obsolete `<Compile Remove>` and `<AvaloniaResource Remove>` tags from `CST.Avalonia.csproj`, making the project file clean and consistent with the active source tree.

### **Previously Completed Milestones**
- **Docking UI**: Migrated to `Dock.Avalonia` for a flexible, multi-pane IDE-style layout.
- **Full State Restoration**: The application saves and restores its complete state (open books, scripts, window size, etc.).
- **Settings Window**: A complete settings dialog is implemented and functional.
- **WebView Confirmed**: The project uses `WebViewControl-Avalonia` for rendering.

### **Key Code Analysis Findings:**

#### 1. **Architecture & Dependencies**
- **`CST.Avalonia.csproj` Analysis**:
  - The project file is now clean and only references active source code.
  - Placeholder and legacy files for features like the `SearchService` are no longer referenced and have been physically moved.
- **Service Configuration (`App.axaml.cs`)**:
  - **Active Services**: `IApplicationStateService`, `ISettingsService`, `IScriptService`, `ILocalizationService`, `IIndexingService`, `IXmlFileDatesService`.
  - **Inactive Services**: `ISearchService` and `IBookService` remain unregistered, but the indexing foundation is now complete. The placeholder files for search services now reside in the `CST.Avalonia_inactive` directory.

## Current Functionality

### **Working Features**
1.  **Dock-Based UI**: Fully functional IDE-style interface.
2.  **Session Restore**: Application correctly reopens all previously opened books.
3.  **Per-Tab Script Selection**: Each book tab remembers its script setting.
4.  **Persistent Highlighting**: Search terms are saved per-tab and reapplied on restore.
5.  **Settings Dialog**: Functional settings window.
6.  **Advanced Logging**: Configurable Serilog implementation.
7.  **Cross-Platform Build**: `.dmg` packages are being built for macOS.
8.  **ðŸ†• Full Indexing System**: Complete Lucene.NET search index for all 217 books with incremental updates.
9.  **ðŸ†• Multi-Script Support**: Devanagari and IPE analyzers with position-based search capabilities.
10. **ðŸ†• Production-Ready Services**: Fully tested IndexingService and XmlFileDatesService with 62 comprehensive tests.

## Outstanding Work (High Priority)

1.  **Implement Live Search UI**: With the complete indexing foundation now in place, the remaining work is to build the search user interface.
    - **Re-integrate `SearchService`**: Move `SearchService.cs` from `CST.Avalonia_inactive` back into the project and register it with DI.
    - **Build Search UI**: Move the `SearchView` and `SearchViewModel` files back and integrate them into the `Dock.Avalonia` layout.
    - **Connect to Index**: Wire the SearchService to use the existing Lucene index for fast, position-based searches.
2.  **Search Results Integration**: Implement search result highlighting and navigation within the BookDisplayView.
3.  **Advanced Search Features**: Add support for proximity searches, wildcards, and regex patterns (infrastructure is ready).

## Test Coverage

The project now includes comprehensive testing with **62 tests** covering:

- **Unit Tests (45)**: Core service functionality, error handling, edge cases
- **Integration Tests (11)**: Service interaction, dependency injection, workflows  
- **Performance Tests (6)**: Speed benchmarks, memory optimization, consistency

All tests maintain a **100% pass rate** and validate production readiness.

## Next Steps

With the complete indexing foundation now in place (including full test coverage), the path forward is clear:

1. **Search UI Implementation**: Move search components from `CST.Avalonia_inactive` and integrate them with the existing Lucene index.
2. **Search Results Display**: Connect search results to the BookDisplayView with highlighting.
3. **Advanced Search Features**: Leverage the position-based index for proximity, wildcard, and regex searches.

The heavy lifting of indexing, optimization, and testing is complete. The remaining work focuses on user interface integration with the robust search infrastructure that's now fully operational.
