# CST Avalonia Project Status - October 2025

## Current Status: **BETA 3 IN DEVELOPMENT** üöß

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025
**Working Directory**: `[project-root]/src/CST.Avalonia`

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinForms-based CST4, built on Avalonia UI and .NET 9. The application is a cross-platform Pali text reader featuring a modern, dock-based IDE-style interface. The active codebase is now focused solely on the current architecture, with legacy and placeholder files moved to a separate directory for clarity.

CST stands for "Cha·π≠·π≠ha Sa·πÖgƒÅyana Tipi·π≠aka". The texts we use are provided by the Vipassana Research Institute. 

Claude, do not use the word "Buddhist" in the application or any supporting documentation.

## Current Functionality

CST Reader is a modern, cross-platform Pali text reader featuring a complete implementation of the following systems:

### **Core Application Features**
1. **Dock-Based IDE Interface**: Fully functional docking system with resizable panels, tab management, and persistent layout state
2. **Complete Session Restoration**: Application saves and restores all open books, scripts, window positions, and search highlights across sessions
3. **Cross-Platform Build System**: Native macOS `.dmg` packages with proper application branding and menu integration
4. **Code Signing & Security**: Developer ID signed applications and DMG installers for macOS without "damaged" application errors on first launch
5. **Advanced Logging System**: Structured Serilog logging with configurable levels, unified across all components including CST.Lucene

### **Text Display & Script System**
6. **Multi-Script Support**:
   - **Display**: All 14 Pali scripts supported (Devanagari, Latin, Bengali, Cyrillic, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Khmer, Malayalam, Myanmar, Sinhala, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan)
   - **Input**: All 14 scripts supported for search/dictionary input
   - **Indexing**: IPE (Ideal Pali Encoding) with Devanagari analyzers for accurate search
7. **Per-Tab Script Selection**: Each book tab independently remembers and applies its script setting
8. **Script Synchronization**: Search results and book tree automatically update display when global script changes
9. **Script Conversion Validation & Quality Assurance**:
   - **Comprehensive Round-Trip Testing**: Automated validation tool tests Deva ‚Üí IPE ‚Üí Script ‚Üí IPE ‚Üí Script conversions for all 14 Pali scripts
   - **Corpus-Based Test Coverage**: 2,248 carefully selected words covering all unique syllable patterns and 140 medial independent vowel patterns found in the 217-book Pali corpus
   - **Multiple Testing Modes**:
     - `validate`: Round-trip conversion accuracy testing with HTML reports
     - `compare`: Compare CST converters against external converters (pnfo, Aksharamukha)
     - `analyze`: Deep analysis of individual problematic words
     - `extract`: Generate minimal test sets from full corpus
   - **Production Impact**: This validation framework enabled:
     - Rapid development of 5 missing input parsers (Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam)
     - Rapid development of 5 missing script converters (Khmer, Myanmar, Sinhala, Telugu, Tibetan)
     - Discovery and fix of longstanding bugs in converters/parsers
     - **99.96% success rate** across all 13 scripts (Thai, Myanmar, Latin, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tibetan, Sinhala, Khmer, Telugu, Cyrillic)
   - **Known Limitations**:
     - **Cyrillic**: ~15 failures (0.67%) due to inherent encoding ambiguity for consonant + –∞–∞ patterns
     - **All Scripts**: 1 shared failure due to Latin transliteration ambiguity (`‡§ó‡•ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§π` vs `‡§ó‡•ç‡§ò` - "g+g+h" vs "g+gh") in likely erroneous source word
   - **Documentation**: See `src/CST.ScriptValidation/README.md` for complete usage guide and technical details

### **UI Font Management System**
10. **Per-Script UI Font Configuration**: Complete font system for all 14 Pali scripts used in UI elements (search results, tree views, dropdowns) with individual font family and size settings
11. **Native Font Detection**: macOS Core Text APIs detect and filter fonts compatible with each specific script
12. **System Default Detection**: Shows actual system-chosen default fonts for each script (informational)
13. **Real-Time Font Updates**: Font changes apply immediately across all UI locations without restart
14. **DataTemplate Font Binding**: Custom FontHelper attached properties enable font settings in search results, tree views, and dropdowns
15. **Font Settings Persistence**: All UI font preferences save and restore correctly across application sessions
    - **Note**: This system covers Pali script fonts in UI elements only; book content fonts and UI localization fonts are separate systems (see Outstanding Work)

### **Search System**
16. **Full-Text Search Engine**: Complete Lucene.NET 4.8+ implementation with position-based indexing for all 217 Pali texts
17. **Advanced Search Features**:
    - Single and multi-term exact searches with accurate counting
    - **Phrase Search**: Quoted terms (e.g., `"eva·πÉ me"`) find exact adjacent word sequences
    - **Proximity Search**: Unquoted multi-word searches find terms within adjustable word distance (default: 10 words)
    - **Two-Color Highlighting**: Blue background for primary search terms, green background for context words in proximity matches
    - **Tag Crossing Detection**: Proper XML structure preservation when highlights span CST's partial word bolding and quotation markup
    - Wildcard search (`*` and `?`) working in all 14 scripts, with expansion support in multi-word searches
    - Regular expression search support
    - Position-based highlighting with correct character offsets
18. **Smart Book Filtering**:
    - Checkbox-based filter UI for Pitaka/Commentary categories
    - "Select All/None" quick actions for filter management
    - Live book count display based on current filter selection
    - Filter summary display when collapsed
19. **Enhanced Search UI**:
    - Visual search elements (magnifying glass, clear button, progress indicator)
    - Two-column layout with terms list and book occurrences
    - Real-time search statistics and loading feedback
    - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape) and double-click navigation
20. **Search Result Integration**: Persistent highlighting saved per-tab, search terms passed to book display

### **Indexing & File Management**
21. **Incremental Indexing System**: Smart indexing that only processes changed files, not entire 217-book corpus
22. **Production-Ready Services**: Fully tested IndexingService and XmlFileDatesService with 62 comprehensive unit/integration/performance tests
23. **Empty Index Handling**: Proper startup behavior when no search index exists yet
24. **Index Integrity**: Fixed duplicate document issues, accurate search counts, proper document replacement

### **XML Update System**
25. **GitHub API Integration**: Automatic file updates using Octokit.NET with repository configuration in Settings
26. **SHA-Based Change Detection**: Only downloads files that have actually changed since local copies (avoids 1GB+ full downloads)
27. **Enhanced File Tracking**: Nullable timestamps, proper state management, separation between download and indexing states
28. **Optimized Startup Sequence**: Files updated before indexing to eliminate redundant work
29. **Reduced Logging Noise**: 95% reduction in startup logging (300KB+ ‚Üí 14KB) while preserving debug information

### **Dynamic Welcome Page System**
30. **Version-Aware Messaging**: Displays version-specific messages (beta feedback, stable notifications, outdated warnings) based on user's current version
31. **Automatic Announcements**: Shows targeted announcements and critical notices filtered by version and expiration dates
32. **GitHub Integration**: Fetches update configuration from GitHub main branch with 24-hour local caching and offline fallback
33. **Semantic Version Comparison**: Robust version parsing with support for pre-release identifiers and build metadata
34. **External Link Handling**: Welcome page links (GitHub releases, documentation) open in system browser instead of internal navigation
35. **Smart Caching**: Local cache with TTL management, graceful degradation when offline, and automatic refresh for stale data

### **User Interface Polish**
36. **Mac-Style Book Tree Icons**: Dynamic folder icons (open/closed states) with document icons for individual books
37. **Tab Overflow Fix**: Custom scrollbar styling prevents tab coverage when many books are open
38. **Clean Settings Window**: Removed all non-functional placeholder settings, only displays working functionality
39. **Application Branding**: Proper "CST Reader" branding in macOS menu bar, window titles, and bundle configuration
40. **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators, loading states, dynamic layouts, and proper iconography throughout UI
41. **Welcome Page with Startup Progress**: Persistent welcome page displays status updates during startup for XML checking, downloading, and indexing operations (fully working on macOS)
42. **Dark Mode Support**: Complete Dark Mode support for all UI panels (main window toolbar, book view toolbar/status bar, search panel, settings window) and book content area with proper FluentTheme integration
43. **Dark Mode Book Content**: WebView book content displays with black background and white text when system is in Dark Mode, with proper color-inverted search highlighting
44. **macOS Tahoe Glass Icon**: Application icon with proper transparency support for macOS Tahoe Glass interface, eliminating grey background artifacts

### **Technical Architecture**
45. **Modern .NET 9**: Built on latest .NET with Avalonia UI 11.x for cross-platform desktop development
46. **Reactive MVVM**: ReactiveUI-based ViewModels with proper lifecycle management and event handling
47. **Dependency Injection**: Clean service architecture with Microsoft.Extensions.DI container
48. **WebView Rendering**: Uses WebViewControl-Avalonia for book content display with search highlighting
49. **Comprehensive Testing**: 65+ tests covering unit, integration, and performance scenarios with 100% pass rate

### **macOS Packaging & Distribution**
50. **CEF WebView Packaging**: Four helper app bundles (Main, GPU, Plugin, Renderer) with proper Info.plist files and shell script launchers that ensure runtime dependencies are found
51. **Developer ID Signing**: All components signed with Apple Developer ID Application certificate, including executables and dylibs
52. **Hardened Runtime**: Applied with JIT and unsigned memory entitlements for .NET runtime compatibility
53. **Notarization**: DMG packages fully notarized with automated build workflow
54. **Production-Ready Distribution**: Apps launch without quarantine warnings or "damaged" errors on first launch

## Known Limitations

### **macOS CPU Usage**

CST Reader exhibits elevated CPU usage on macOS compared to typical desktop applications:

- **~30% CPU** with only the welcome page open (single WebView)
- **~60% CPU** with 3 books open (3 WebView instances)
- Main process typically uses **27-30%** when idle

**Root Cause**: This is a known limitation of Avalonia's macOS native backend (`libAvaloniaNative.dylib`). The framework's `Signaler` class creates a CFRunLoop observer that fires on every run loop iteration, causing continuous background processing. CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) amplifies this effect by performing process monitoring and rendering checks on each callback.

**Comparison with Other Platforms**:
- macOS (M1): 6-10% idle (Avalonia baseline) vs Windows: 0.48% idle
- CST Reader's usage is proportional to the number of open WebView instances

**User Mitigation**:
- Close book tabs when not in use (each tab adds ~10% CPU)
- Keep welcome page open when idle (lowest CPU state)

**Technical Details**: See `markdown/notes/AVALONIA_HIGH_CPU.md` for complete analysis including CPU profiling data, stack traces, and references to Avalonia GitHub issues (#11070, #15894).

**Note**: This is an Avalonia framework limitation, not a CST Reader bug. Future improvements depend on Avalonia framework optimizations or alternative rendering approaches.

## Outstanding Work

    - **Multi-Language Support**: Implement complete localization for 20+ spoken languages (matching CST4 functionality)
    - **Runtime Language Switching**: Allow users to change UI language without restart
    - **String Tables**: Port existing string tables from CST4 for all supported languages
    - **Settings Integration**: Add language selection to Settings window
    - **Resource Management**: Implement proper resource loading system for localized strings
    - **Note**: This is separate from Pali script selection but often related in user preferences
2.  **UI Language Font System**:
    - **Localization Font Settings**: Separate font controls for ~20 UI languages (distinct from Pali script fonts)
    - **Font Discovery**: Detect available fonts suitable for each UI language script
    - **Note**: This is separate from Pali script fonts - refers to UI language localization fonts
3.  **Book Content Font Management System**:
    - **Current Limitation**: Book fonts are hardcoded in XSL stylesheets (e.g., `.book { font-size: 21pt; }`), requiring manual XSL editing for customization (as in CST4)

    - **Style Customization**: Support for different paragraph styles tagged in TEI XML (matching CST4's XSL customization capabilities)
    - **Preview System**: Live preview of font changes in book display
    - **Note**: This is the third distinct font system - separate from both UI Pali script fonts (#9-14) and UI localization fonts (#2)
4.  **Custom Book Collections**: Implement user-defined book collection feature for targeted searches
5.  **UI Feedback During Operations**:
    - **Update History**: Track and display XML update history for transparency
6.  **Book Display Features**:

    - **Search Hit Restoration** ‚≠ê **BETA 3 PRIORITY**: Fix bug where highlighted search hits are not restored when reopening books at startup
7.  **Search Hit Navigation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **BROKEN**:
    - **Current Status**: Navigation between highlighted search hits is not working (broken during recent development)
    - **Required Fix**: Restore functionality for navigating between search hits in book content
    - **Enhancement**: Add keyboard shortcuts for search hit navigation (First/Previous/Next/Last)
    - **Note**: This was working previously but has been broken, needs investigation and repair
8.  **Recent Books Feature**:
    - **File Menu Integration**: Add "Recent Books" submenu to File menu or main UI
    - **MRU List Display**: Show recently opened books with titles and last-opened dates
    - **Smart Tracking**: Automatically add books to recent list when opened
    - **Settings Integration**: Re-implement MaxRecentBooks setting to control list size
    - **Persistence**: Leverage existing ApplicationState.RecentBooks infrastructure
    - **User Experience**: Quick access to frequently used texts
    - **Note**: Partial backend exists - ApplicationState.Preferences.RecentBooks list, RecentBookItem model, AddRecentBook() method, but no UI integration and book tracking not implemented
9.  **Dictionary Feature**:
    - **English Dictionary**: Implement Pali-English dictionary lookup (matching CST4 functionality)
    - **Hindi Dictionary**: Implement Pali-Hindi dictionary lookup (matching CST4 functionality)

## Development Guidelines for Claude

### TodoWrite Usage - IMPORTANT

**ALWAYS use TodoWrite when:**
- Diagnosing issues with **multiple potential causes** (e.g., "this could be A, B, or C")
- Implementing features requiring **3+ distinct steps**
- Working through **any systematic checklist** (testing, deployment, debugging)
- The user provides **a list of tasks** to complete
- Starting work on **non-trivial, multi-step tasks**

**How to use TodoWrite effectively:**
1. **Create the list IMMEDIATELY** when you identify multiple steps/causes
2. **Work through ALL items systematically** - don't stop after the first fix
3. **Mark tasks complete as you finish them** - keep the user informed of progress
4. **Verify assumptions** - check for existing solutions before adding new ones

**Example - Multi-Cause Debugging:**
```
When I identify: "This hang is likely due to: 1) Network entitlements 2) Infinite timeout 3) DNS issues"
I should IMMEDIATELY create:
- [ ] Check if network entitlements exist
- [ ] Add network entitlements if missing
- [ ] Add timeouts to prevent infinite hangs
- [ ] Verify DNS resolution in packaged app

Then work through ALL items, not just the first one that seems to help.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents incomplete fixes that leave users stuck
- Ensures systematic coverage of all potential issues
- Keeps both Claude and user aligned on progress
- Critical for release-blocking bugs where partial fixes waste time

### macOS Code Signing & Entitlements

**Required Entitlements** (in `package-macos.sh`):

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required for .NET JIT compilation -->

<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required for .NET runtime -->

<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required to load .NET assemblies -->

<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>  <!-- Required for outgoing network connections (GitHub API, downloads) -->
```

**When Adding New Features:**
1. **Check if new entitlements are needed** - consult [Apple's Entitlement Key Reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements)
2. **Common additional entitlements you might need:**
   - `com.apple.security.network.server` - Incoming network connections
   - `com.apple.security.device.camera` - Camera access
   - `com.apple.security.device.microphone` - Microphone access
   - `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write` - Downloads folder access
   - `com.apple.security.print` - Printing capabilities
   - `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` - Enable App Sandbox (currently disabled)

3. **Test entitlements after packaging:**
   ```bash
   # Verify entitlements are embedded
   codesign -d --entitlements - "/Applications/CST Reader.app"
   ```

**Critical:** Notarized apps **WILL FAIL SILENTLY** without proper entitlements. Network calls will hang indefinitely (causing high CPU from retry loops) rather than showing clear errors.

## Next Steps

With font system, script synchronization, phrase/proximity search, two-color highlighting, complete Dark Mode support (UI and book content), macOS Tahoe Glass icon transparency, and all 14 Pali script input parsers complete, the immediate priorities are:

1. **Beta 3 Priority Items**:
   - Fix search hit restoration bug (highlighted search hits not restored when reopening books at startup)
2. **Custom Book Collections**: Implement user-defined book collection feature for targeted searches
3. **Search Navigation Enhancements**: Add keyboard shortcuts for search hit navigation (First/Previous/Next/Last)

The core infrastructure is robust with font management, full script conversion support (all 14 scripts for both display and input), accurate search counting, phrase/proximity search with two-color highlighting, complete Dark Mode support for all UI and book content, macOS Tahoe Glass icon transparency, and real-time UI updates all working correctly. Focus now shifts to Beta 3 release preparation with the search hit restoration fix as the remaining priority item.
