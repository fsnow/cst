# CST Avalonia Project Status - August 2025

## Current Status: **SEARCH & HIGHLIGHTING IMPLEMENTATION** üîç

**Last Updated**: August 13, 2025
**Working Directory**: `/Users/fsnow/github/fsnow/cst/src/CST.Avalonia`

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinForms-based CST4, built on Avalonia UI and .NET 9. The application is a cross-platform Buddhist text reader featuring a modern, dock-based IDE-style interface. The active codebase is now focused solely on the current architecture, with legacy and placeholder files moved to a separate directory for clarity.

## Previous Session Updates (2025-08-09)

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR MILESTONE: Incremental Indexing Bug Fixes Complete**
- **Bug Fix #1 - Incremental Detection**: Fixed issue where file changes weren't being detected for indexing by removing conditional check in `App.axaml.cs:line 86`
- **Bug Fix #2 - Settings Enhancement**: Added logic to save default index directory to settings when created for first time in `IndexingService.cs:lines 46-49`
- **Bug Fix #3 - Critical Performance Fix**: Fixed major bug where incremental indexing processed all 217 books instead of only changed files
  - **Root Cause**: `BookIndexer.cs:lines 79-88` was indexing all books with `DocId < 0`, not just the changed ones
  - **Solution**: Modified `IndexAll` method to only process books in the `changedFiles` list during incremental updates
  - **Impact**: Incremental indexing now properly handles single file changes without reprocessing entire corpus
  - **Test Validation**: Created `IncrementalIndexingOnlyChangedBooksTest` confirming fix works correctly

### ‚úÖ **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Complete Indexing System Implementation**
- **Full Index Implementation**: Successfully implemented all phases 1-3 of the indexing plan, with all 217 books indexed.
- **CST.Lucene Integration**: Modern Lucene.NET 4.8+ implementation with async support, progress reporting, and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Production Services**: `IndexingService` and `XmlFileDatesService` fully implemented with dependency injection integration.
- **Index Created**: Successfully created search index for all 217 Buddhist texts with position-based search support.

### ‚úÖ **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Comprehensive Testing & Optimization (Phase 4)**
- **62 Tests Implemented**: Complete test coverage with 100% pass rate including unit, integration, and performance tests.
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Unit Tests**: XmlFileDatesService, IndexingService, corruption recovery, multi-script support
  - **Integration Tests**: Full service integration, cross-service communication, lifecycle management
  - **Performance Tests**: Speed benchmarking, memory optimization, consistency validation
  - **Structure Tests**: Position-based search verification, index integrity, multi-document handling
- **Performance Validated**: All services meet performance targets (< 1s initialization, < 100ms validation, < 10MB memory)

### ‚úÖ **PREVIOUS MILESTONE: Project Cleanup & Refactoring**
- **Dead Code Identified**: Analyzed the `.csproj` file to identify numerous files from a previous architectural approach that were excluded from the build.
- **Inactive Code Archived**: Created a new `CST.Avalonia_inactive` directory to house all legacy and placeholder files, clarifying the current state of the active project.
  - **Moved Files**: `BookService.cs`, `SearchService.cs`, the legacy `MainWindow.axaml` and its code-behind, and other unused View and ViewModel files were relocated.
- **Project File Cleanup**: Removed all obsolete `<Compile Remove>` and `<AvaloniaResource Remove>` tags from `CST.Avalonia.csproj`, making the project file clean and consistent with the active source tree.

### **Previously Completed Milestones**
- **Docking UI**: Migrated to `Dock.Avalonia` for a flexible, multi-pane IDE-style layout.
- **Full State Restoration**: The application saves and restores its complete state (open books, scripts, window size, etc.).
- **Settings Window**: A complete settings dialog is implemented and functional.
- **WebView Confirmed**: The project uses `WebViewControl-Avalonia` for rendering.

### **Key Code Analysis Findings:**

#### 1. **Architecture & Dependencies**
- **`CST.Avalonia.csproj` Analysis**:
  - The project file is now clean and only references active source code.
  - Placeholder and legacy files for features like the `SearchService` are no longer referenced and have been physically moved.
- **Service Configuration (`App.axaml.cs`)**:
  - **Active Services**: `IApplicationStateService`, `ISettingsService`, `IScriptService`, `ILocalizationService`, `IIndexingService`, `IXmlFileDatesService`, `ISearchService`.
  - **Search Integration**: SearchService fully integrated with DI and connected to the Lucene index.

## Current Functionality

### **Working Features**
1.  **Dock-Based UI**: Fully functional IDE-style interface.
2.  **Session Restore**: Application correctly reopens all previously opened books.
3.  **Per-Tab Script Selection**: Each book tab remembers its script setting.
4.  **Persistent Highlighting**: Search terms are saved per-tab and reapplied on restore.
5.  **Settings Dialog**: Functional settings window.
6.  **Advanced Logging**: Configurable Serilog implementation.
7.  **Cross-Platform Build**: `.dmg` packages are being built for macOS.
8.  **Full Indexing System**: Complete Lucene.NET search index for all 217 books with incremental updates.
9.  **Multi-Script Support**: Devanagari and IPE analyzers with position-based search capabilities.
10. **Production-Ready Services**: Fully tested IndexingService and XmlFileDatesService with 62 comprehensive tests.
11. **üÜï Live Search UI**: Functional search panel with real-time results and book filtering.
12. **üÜï Search Result Highlighting**: Position-based highlighting with navigation support (single-term tested).

## Outstanding Work (High Priority)

1.  **Advanced Search Features**:
    - **Phrase Search**: Implement position-based phrase searching with exact word order matching

    - **Custom Book Collections**: Implement user-defined book collection feature for targeted searches
3.  **Search Navigation Enhancement**:
    - Add keyboard shortcuts for search hit navigation (First/Previous/Next/Last)

2. **Search Filtering**: Fix book collection checkboxes and implement custom collection support for targeted searches
3. **Advanced Search Modes**: Complete wildcard/regex support and optimize for complex search patterns
4. **Navigation & UX**: Add keyboard shortcuts, hit navigation, and user experience improvements

The foundation is solid with accurate counting and multi-term highlighting working. Focus now shifts to advanced search features and collection filtering.
